"""Command-line interface for the Apache Ossie <-> ThoughtSpot TML converter.

    ossie-thoughtspot to-ossie   <tml-file>... -o <out.yaml>  [--issues <issues.json>]
    ossie-thoughtspot to-tml     <ossie.yaml>  -o <out-dir>   [--issues <issues.json>]

`to-ossie` reads a Model TML document plus the Table/SQL View documents it references
and writes one Apache Ossie semantic model. `to-tml` reads one Apache Ossie semantic
model and writes the corresponding TML document set -- one file per document, tables
before the model -- into an output directory.

`-o`/`--output` is required in both directions: `to-ossie` writes exactly one file, and
`to-tml` writes a set of files that has no single-file stdout representation, so unlike
some sibling converters there is no "default: stdout" fallback here.

Every declared loss or degradation the conversion records is written as a JSON array of
issues -- to `--issues` when given, to stderr otherwise -- and never mixed into the
document output. The process exits 1 when that issue log contains an ERROR-severity
issue, 0 otherwise: a conversion that only warned or informed about a declared loss is
still a successful conversion, and failing the exit code on a warning would just teach
scripts to ignore it.

Neither subcommand overwrites an existing output file unless `--force` is given; without
it, a target that already exists refuses the run before anything is written.
