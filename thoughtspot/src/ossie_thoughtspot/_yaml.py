"""YAML codec with the boolean resolver narrowed to YAML 1.2.

PyYAML implements YAML 1.1, in which `on`, `off`, `yes`, `no`, `y` and `n`
resolve to booleans. TML uses such tokens as ordinary strings, so a bare
`yaml.safe_load` corrupts them silently. Only the boolean resolver is
narrowed here — no other YAML 1.1/1.2 divergence (e.g. octal/sexagesimal
number parsing) is addressed.

Both directions matter. The loader stops 1.1 bool tokens becoming booleans; the
dumper quotes them on the way out so the next reader — which may be a 1.1
implementation — cannot re-resolve them.
