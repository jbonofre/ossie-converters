"""Expression translation: the Ossie expression language <-> ThoughtSpot formulas.

Public surface:
    - `Classification`, `Variant`, `Construct` — the shared vocabulary the forward
      catalog, the emitters and the reverse inventory all use.
    - `CATALOG` — every specification construct mapped to a ThoughtSpot rendering.
    - `spec_construct_names()` — the upstream-spec coverage oracle: reads
      core-spec/expression_language.md directly so a construct added upstream fails
      this package's build instead of silently going unsupported.
    - `CONVENTION_DIVERGENCES` — constructs the mapping document counts one row per
      construct that have no discrete row in the upstream spec.
    - `emit_direct`, `emit_passthrough`, `emit_unmappable` — render a `Construct`
      into an actual ThoughtSpot formula, one function per `Classification`.
    - `REVERSE`, `ReverseConstruct`, `ReverseDisposition`, `translate_thoughtspot`,
      `stash_runtime_parameter` — the reverse-direction inventory (ThoughtSpot
      functions with no counterpart in the Ossie specification) and its translator.
    - `thoughtspot_dialect_entry`, `portable_dialect_entry`,
      `custom_extensions_fragment` — helpers a caller combines with
      `translate_thoughtspot`'s result to satisfy roundtrip at the object level.
