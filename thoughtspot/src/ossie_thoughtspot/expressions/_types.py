                  Not every DIRECT/PASSTHROUGH template is a complete, positionally
                  substitutable one — THREE shapes diverge from that default. Read
                  `variadic` and `exemplar_literals` before formatting this field: two of
                  the three fail loud on a naive `.format()` (a raised ValueError or
                  KeyError, or rejection at TML import), but the fold-variadic shape does
                  NOT, and silently drops arguments instead:

                  - A "dispatch" template — literal text such as "per-type — see note" or
                    "per-pattern-shape — see note" — for a row whose actual ThoughtSpot
                    rendering depends on a runtime value not known at catalog-construction
                    time (CAST's per-type table, the EXTRACT/DATE_PART/DATE_TRUNC/DATEADD
                    family, TRUE/FALSE, both CASE forms, the column/metric reference, the
                    unary +/- row, and several window rows). A caller building a uniform
                    `.format()` dispatcher off this field alone will hit these ~20 rows and
                    must special-case them; each row's `note` says so and describes the
                    real dispatch.
                  - A "variadic" template — six rows, flagged by a non-None `variadic`.
                    A JOIN-style one carries the `{*}` tail marker (`concat ( {*} )`,
                    `{0} in {{ {*} }}`) and `str.format` raises `KeyError('*')` on it, so
                    that half is loud. A FOLD-style one is the exception to this whole
                    paragraph: `COALESCE`'s template is the BINARY `ifnull ( {0} , {1} )`,
                    applied right-associatively by `_emit_variadic` because ThoughtSpot
                    has no n-ary `ifnull`. Formatting it directly with three arguments
                    returns `ifnull ( a , b )` and drops the third WITHOUT error — the one
                    place in this dataclass where reading `template` alone is silently
                    wrong rather than loudly wrong. `emit_direct` routes every variadic
                    row to `_emit_variadic`, so the converter itself is not exposed to
                    this; an external caller reading the catalog is.
                  - An "exemplar" PASSTHROUGH template — a complete, renderable body that
                    bakes ONE caller-supplied value in as a literal while still declaring a
                    satisfiable arity (`PERCENTILE_CONT`/`DISC`'s `0.75`, `NTILE`'s `4`,
                    `LAG`/`LEAD`'s offset `1`, and others — see `emit_passthrough`'s
                    docstring for the full convention). This kind renders without error, so
                    the arg-count guard alone does not distinguish it from a genuinely
                    complete template: treating the baked-in literal as universal instead of
                    rebuilding the template per real occurrence is silently wrong, not
                    loud — `PERCENTILE_CONT(0.9)` would render as a P75 measure that imports
                    and runs. Each such row's `note` names the baked-in value.
    `variant`     required for PASSTHROUGH, forbidden otherwise.
    `note`        the row's caveat, verbatim enough to be traceable to the document.
