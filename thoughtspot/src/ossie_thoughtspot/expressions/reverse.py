"""The reverse-direction inventory: ThoughtSpot functions with no counterpart in the
Ossie specification.

`CATALOG` (catalog.py) is the specification's own inventory, Ossie construct -> ThoughtSpot
rendering. This module is the other half of a bidirectional converter: ThoughtSpot's own
native functions that the 146-row `CATALOG` never targets, sourced from the "Reverse
direction (ThoughtSpot -> Ossie)" section of
docs/ossie/ts-ossie-function-mapping.md (thoughtspot-agent-skills repo, not vendored here) —
its three sub-sections (conditional aggregates and arithmetic helpers; window, LOD and
semi-additive functions; runtime, display and calendar concepts).

One governing idea shapes the whole module: prefer composition over the stash. Most of ThoughtSpot's
apparently-proprietary functions are sugar over constructs the specification already has
(`sum_if` -> `SUM(CASE WHEN ...)`, `safe_divide` -> `COALESCE(a / NULLIF(b, 0), 0)`,
`group_sum` over a fixed grain -> `SUM(x) OVER (PARTITION BY attr)`). The stash
(`custom_extensions` + issue) is for what genuinely has no expression — a short
list dominated by *runtime* concepts (parameters, signed-in-user identity, display markup,
fiscal calendars), not by missing mathematics.

Four dispositions, not the forward module's three
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
`Classification` (catalog.py's DIRECT/PASSTHROUGH/UNMAPPABLE) does not fit this direction
cleanly, so this module defines its own `ReverseDisposition` rather than bending it (as
instructed): a reverse row can compose fully, compose *partially* (with a real fidelity
loss that still deserves an issue and a preserved verbatim rendering), resolve to
the Ossie `dialects[]` mechanism instead of a portable expression at all, or have no
expression whatsoever.

    COMPOSE   a full Ossie expression is produced. May still carry a caveat issue (locale
              dependence, a week-start-day or DAYOFWEEK-base assumption) without being lossy
              in the way PARTIAL is — the composition is exact, the caveat is about the
              *specification's* own portability, not about this construct's translation.
    PARTIAL   a real Ossie expression is produced, but it is provably incomplete (the
              `moving_*`/`cumulative_*` family: the frame and order translate exactly, the
              partition does not — a ThoughtSpot window formula cannot declare its own
              PARTITION BY, and the specification has no way to express that limitation).
              Always logs a WARNING and the caller should pair the composed expression with a THOUGHTSPOT dialect
              entry (`thoughtspot_dialect_entry`) carrying the verbatim original — and an
              ANSI_SQL sibling (`portable_dialect_entry`) for the composed expression itself,
              since it *is* portable, just incomplete: a consumer that does not implement the
              THOUGHTSPOT dialect still gets something it can execute.
    DIALECT   the construct's natural home is the Ossie `dialects[]` mechanism, not a
              portable expression — the eleven `sql_*_op` / `sql_*_aggregate_op` names. No
              ANSI_SQL sibling is ever emitted for these (the document is explicit: raw
              warehouse SQL's portability is exactly what is unknown).
    STASH     no Ossie expression exists at all. Always logs an ERROR (mirroring
              `emit_unmappable`'s severity choice for the same "no representation, preserved
              only for roundtrip" shape) and the caller should attach a THOUGHTSPOT
              dialect entry with the verbatim call.

Argument abstraction level
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
`translate_thoughtspot(name, args, log, *, object_ref, ...)` takes `args` as already-
extracted operand strings, exactly the abstraction level `emit_direct`/`emit_passthrough`
take in the forward direction (never raw ThoughtSpot formula text with nested calls or
brace/quote syntax to parse) — no expression parser exists yet, so there is nothing to parse
from either direction yet. A caller with a real parsed formula tree supplies the resolved
operand strings positionally.

`translate_thoughtspot` carries `object_ref` as a required keyword-only parameter beyond the
plain `(name, args, log)` shape: `IssueLog.add` requires it, the same shape
`emit_passthrough`/`emit_unmappable` already use for the identical reason. A second keyword-
only parameter, `connection_dialect`, is added for the DIALECT family only (see
`_dispatch_sql_op`) — the document itself says resolving these needs the connection's own
dialect, which is not derivable from a bare function name and argument list.

Two constructs are cross-cutting rather than name-keyed, so they are not `REVERSE` entries
looked up by `name` at all:

- **The fiscal-calendar argument.** The document describes this as "the rest of the fiscal
  family" without enumerating every date function it can decorate, so `translate_thoughtspot`
  checks for a trailing literal `fiscal` argument up front, for any `name` at all, before
  falling through to a normal lookup.
- **The runtime-parameter reference.** A bracketed name (`[Discount Threshold]`) is
  syntactically identical to an ordinary column reference (`[Table::Column]`) — this module
  has no model metadata to tell the two apart, so there is no way to safely auto-detect it in
  `translate_thoughtspot`. `stash_runtime_parameter` is exposed separately; the caller (which
  does have the model's declared parameter list) invokes it directly once it has confirmed
  the name in hand is a declared parameter and not a column.

Two more are shape-dependent rather than purely name-keyed, and use `ReverseConstruct`'s
`dispatch_fn` escape hatch (full control over composing vs. stashing, bypassing the
declarative `template`/`compose_fn` path entirely): `group_aggregate` and its four named
shorthands (`group_sum`, `group_count`, `group_stddev`, `group_variance`), whose disposition
depends on the shape of the grouping and filter arguments (see `_compose_grouped`); and the
eleven `sql_*_op` names, whose disposition depends on whether the caller can supply
`connection_dialect` (see `_dispatch_sql_op`). `concat` is a third, narrower case: plain
`concat` has a spec counterpart already in `CATALOG` and is not this module's concern at all
(returns `None`, no issue) — only the ThoughtSpot hyperlink-markup content pattern inside its
string arguments (`{caption}` / `{/caption}`) is reverse-inventory territory.

    vendor-key wrapping. So this fragment must be keyed by `column`, the caller's
    Ossie metric/column name, not by `VENDOR_KEY`: this module operates at the
    single-expression level and has no access to the enclosing object, so the caller merges
    fragments across an object's columns — `{**fragment_for_col_a, **fragment_for_col_b}` —
    before calling `stash.write_stash` once per object. Keying by `VENDOR_KEY` instead would
    make that merge lossy (`{**f1, **f2}` collapses to whichever fragment merged last) and
    would nest the vendor key inside its own entry when passed to `write_stash` directly.
