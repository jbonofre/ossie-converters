"""The catalog: every specification construct mapped to a ThoughtSpot rendering.

`CATALOG` is organised into families below — Aggregate functions, Type conversion,
Date/time functions, String functions, Mathematical + Conditional functions, Operators
and constructs, and Window functions — one block per family, together covering the full
specification. `spec_construct_names()` is an oracle read from the **upstream**
`core-spec/expression_language.md`: it independently reports every construct the
specification defines, so a construct added upstream in the future fails this package's
build instead of silently going unsupported (see `test_catalog_covers_the_spec.py`).

Extraction approach
--------------------
The spec document mixes three kinds of content that must be told apart:

1. Genuine constructs — a named function, operator or literal form the
   specification defines, almost always as one row of a markdown table whose
   row carries a `Syntax` column (e.g. `SUM(expr)`), or, for a handful of
   operators/keywords with no table of their own, a row of the top-level
   "Supported SQL Constructs" table.
2. Argument vocabularies — the `EXTRACT`/`DATE_PART` parts, the `DATE_TRUNC`
   precisions, the `TO_DATE`/`TO_CHAR` format tokens and the `CAST` target
   types. These describe values an argument may take, not constructs in
   their own right, and must be excluded.
3. Informative tables — the per-engine "Common Dialect Variations" table and
   the "Cross-Reference: Tool Mappings" section describe *other products'*
   spellings (Tableau, Looker Studio, DAX, and per-engine SQL). Names that
   appear only there are not Ossie constructs.

The exclusions are keyed off the document's own structure — a table's own header naming
and section heading text ("Not Supported in Expressions", "Common Dialect Variations",
"Cross-Reference") — rather than a hardcoded list of names to drop, so a renamed or added
upstream construct cannot go silently unnoticed. `_extract_tables()` only looks at lines
starting with "|", so the argument-vocabulary bullet lists are simply invisible to it.

Spelling: `CATALOG` keys must match `spec_construct_names()` exactly
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
`spec_construct_names()` is the oracle for a `CATALOG` key's exact spelling, not any
mapping document's prose. Several rows write their Ossie-side syntax differently than
this parser extracts it; a `CATALOG` entry keyed on a mapping document's own wording
instead of this function's output will read as an "invented" construct even though it is
a real, intended row. When adding or editing a row, run `spec_construct_names()` and
match a member of it exactly, rather than transcribing another document's column text.
Grouped by which extractor produces the divergent spelling:

- **`_extract_tables()`** (an ordinary table with a `Syntax` column):
    - Alias pairs the spec merges into ONE table row keep this parser's single
      extracted spelling: `CEIL(x)` (not `CEIL(x) / CEILING(x)`), `TRUNC(x, d)`
      (not `.../ TRUNCATE(x, d)`).
    - Two-alternative-syntax rows keep the spec's own joining word, "or":
      `"CURRENT_DATE or CURRENT_DATE()"`, `"CURRENT_TIMESTAMP or
      CURRENT_TIMESTAMP()"`, `"CURRENT_TIME or CURRENT_TIME()"`.
    - The merged boolean-literal row (`BOOLEAN`'s `Syntax` cell) is one entry,
      comma-joined: `"TRUE, FALSE"`.
    - The Boolean Functions table's `AND`/`OR` rows keep the spec's own
      `expr1`/`expr2` placeholder names: `"expr1 AND expr2"`, `"expr1 OR expr2"`.
- **`_extract_summary_rows()`** (the top-level "Supported SQL Constructs"
  table, bare backtick token): `BETWEEN`, `IN`, `NOT IN`, `IS NULL`, `IS NOT NULL`,
  `CASE WHEN`, and the raw symbols `+ - * / % = <> != < > <= >=`.
- **`_extract_null_safe_comparison_operators()`** (the "Null-Safe Comparison"
  code fence, not the summary table): `IS DISTINCT FROM`, `IS NOT DISTINCT FROM`.
- **`_extract_extraction_syntax_functions()`** (the "Alternative Extraction
  Syntax" code fence, bare token, no argument list): `EXTRACT`, `DATE_PART`.
- **`_extract_single_construct_headings()`** (a standalone heading with no
  table, bare token): `CAST`, `TRY_CAST` (not `CAST(expression AS target_type)`).

See `CONVENTION_DIVERGENCES` below for the (much shorter) list of constructs that have
no entry in `spec_construct_names()` at all and are exempted instead.

# because they behave differently in ThoughtSpot but because ThoughtSpot has no

# Nearly every row here is direct, several by composition: SIGN has
# no native function but composes exactly as a three-way `if` chain — the
# trailing `else 0` is mandatory, ThoughtSpot rejects an `if` with no `else`.
# RADIANS/DEGREES are bare dialect-free arithmetic, not passthroughs. PI is a
# literal at the precision ThoughtSpot's own documented trig composites use.
# ThoughtSpot's trigonometry is degrees-native while the specification is
# radians-native, so SIN/COS/TAN convert radians->degrees on the way IN
# (`* 180 / pi`, applied to the argument) and ASIN/ACOS/ATAN convert
# degrees->radians on the way OUT (`* pi / 180`, applied to the result) —
# opposite directions, easy to transpose by mistake, and this comment had them
# transposed. The templates were and are correct; cross-check against the
# DEGREES/RADIANS rows below, which state the same two conversions as their
# whole definition: DEGREES is `* 180 / pi`, RADIANS is `* pi / 180`.
# GREATEST/LEAST are deliberately NOT mapped to max/min: ThoughtSpot's max/min
# are aggregate-only, so that mapping would both collapse the row-wise N-ary
# result to one value and flip it from attribute to measure.
#
# Only two rows are passthrough: TRUNC/TRUNCATE (no native truncation — floor
# only agrees with it for x >= 0, d = 0, and round disagrees at every
# half-value) and ATAN2 (quadrant-aware and defined where x = 0, so it is not
# a two-argument ATAN composition, unlike every other inverse trig function

# Operators and constructs — 33 rows: 30 direct / 2 passthrough /
# 1 unmappable.
# Source: docs/ossie/ts-ossie-function-mapping.md, "Operators and constructs"
# section (thoughtspot-agent-skills repo — not vendored here; prose above/below
# the table read in full).
#
# The document's own section header states that CASE (both forms) and the
# boolean literals/operators are rowed HERE, not under Conditional functions —
# confirmed by the arithmetic: 25 Math + 9 Conditional (the Mathematical +
# Conditional functions family above) + 33 here would double-count CASE otherwise.
#
# spec_construct_names() extracts the BARE operator/keyword token for most of
# this family, not the document's own "a + b"-style worked-example row header —
# confirmed live before writing this block (see test_catalog_operators.py's
# docstring for the full list). Six rows have no discrete spec table row at
# all and are keyed via CONVENTION_DIVERGENCES instead: unary -x/+x, the
# simple CASE form, Parentheses, the DISTINCT modifier, the column/metric
# reference, and EXISTS_IN() itself.
#
# This family holds the single UNMAPPABLE row in the whole 146-row catalog:
# EXISTS_IN() is named at :131 as the sanctioned way to filter on a subquery,
# but the specification defines it nowhere — no signature, no argument order,
# no semantics, absent from every function table. Construct.__post_init__
# forbids a template or variant on an UNMAPPABLE row, so this is the one entry
# in the whole file with neither.
#
# LIKE is direct despite ThoughtSpot having no native starts_with/ends_with:
# the prefix/suffix/contains compositions it needs use only native functions,
# the same reasoning as the String functions family's STARTSWITH/
# ENDSWITH rows above. ILIKE is passthrough for the opposite reason —
# case-insensitive matching has no native form, and the usual lower()-fold
# workaround is itself a passthrough, so there is nothing to compose from. The
# DISTINCT aggregate modifier is passthrough for every aggregate except COUNT,
# which already has its own native unique count row (COUNT(DISTINCT expr),
# in Aggregate functions above).

# Window functions — 14 rows: 5 direct / 9 passthrough / 0 unmappable.
# Source: docs/ossie/ts-ossie-function-mapping.md, "Window functions" section, plus
# "Window rows live-confirmed — 2026-07-30" (thoughtspot-agent-skills repo — not
# vendored here; prose above/below the table read in full).
#
# This is the hardest family, and the last one — it completes the 146-row catalog.
# Three constraints govern it:
#
# - A raw aggregate cannot be nested inside a ThoughtSpot window function. The
#   argument must be a column reference or a group_aggregate ( ... ). Live-confirmed
#   both directions: the raw-aggregate form is rejected, the group_aggregate form
#   validates, for moving_* and cumulative_* alike.
# - ThoughtSpot's ORDER BY column must be a physical column reference, not a
#   formula. A formula column in the sort position fails to resolve.
# - A ThoughtSpot window formula cannot declare its own PARTITION BY; the
#   window shape is completed from the search context. There is no argument slot
#   for a partition and none can be added — live-confirmed by rejection,
#   2026-07-30 (a fifth { [attr] } or query_groups ( ) argument to moving_sum,
#   and a third to cumulative_sum, are both rejected at the parser). rank /
#   rank_percentile are the stricter case: arity fixed at exactly two, enforced
#   ("Function rank expects only 2 arguments"), so they are always global. This
#   is why LAG, LEAD, the OVER clause and window aggregation moved
#   direct -> passthrough in the 2026-07-30 rework (52 live probes, 31 accepted /
#   21 rejected) — a native idiom (moving_sum as the LAG/LEAD idiom) exists but
#   is NOT equivalent to any OVER shape, because it has no partition slot and
#   ThoughtSpot's partition is never empty.
#
# FIRST_VALUE/LAST_VALUE are the section's one exception: they take a genuine,
# explicit partition argument and a genuine, explicit order axis — both
# live-confirmed accepted, including a multi-column fixed partition — so the
# formula does define its own window, and they stay direct. RANK/PERCENT_RANK and
# the frame-clause boundaries also stay direct, with their native reach now proven
# by rejection rather than asserted.
#
# PERCENT_RANK is direct via rank_percentile (both the 0-100 scale and the
# inversion are required); CUME_DIST is NOT a rank_percentile substitute —
# PERCENT_RANK divides by n-1 and starts at 0, CUME_DIST divides by n and ends at
# 1 — so CUME_DIST stays passthrough with no native fallback at all.
#
# RANK, PERCENT_RANK, FIRST_VALUE and LAST_VALUE record the document's own worked
# example verbatim — symbolic bracket names ([m], [dim], [ord], [attr], [T::date]),
# not numbered {0}/{1} substitution slots — because resolving which actual column
# fills each slot needs model metadata not known at catalog-construction time; same
# out-of-scope-dispatch treatment as CASE WHEN's c1/r1 names and CAST's per-type
# table. FIRST_VALUE/LAST_VALUE's worked example carries ThoughtSpot's literal
# `{ [T::date] }` list syntax for the axis argument; since these are DIRECT rows
# rendered via emit_direct's str.format, the literal braces are doubled ({{ }})
# the same fix the IN/NOT IN rows above need for the same reason — verified here by
# actually calling emit_direct and checking the rendered output has single braces
# again (see test_catalog_window.py).
#
# Three of the 14 rows have no discrete row of their own in the upstream spec —
# the OVER clause, the frame clause and window aggregation are keyed via the
# pre-existing CONVENTION_DIVERGENCES entries (copied verbatim, not retyped, to
# avoid an em-dash/ellipsis mismatch) rather than spec_construct_names(). The
# other 11 key on spec_construct_names()'s own extraction from the "Ranking
# Functions" and "Offset Functions" tables' Syntax column — confirmed live before
# writing this block.
