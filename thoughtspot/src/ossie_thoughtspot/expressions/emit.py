"""Render a catalog `Construct` into an actual ThoughtSpot formula.

Three emitters, one per `Classification` (see `_types.py`):

- `emit_direct`      — substitutes `args` into the construct's native ThoughtSpot
                        template positionally. A `direct` row may itself be
                        a composition of native functions, not only a rename — that
                        composition is baked into `construct.template` by the
                        catalog, not by this function.
- `emit_passthrough` — renders a `sql_*_op` call. The row's `variant`
                        fixes both the emitted function name and, through it, the
                        emitted column's type and measure/attribute role. Every call
                        raises a WARNING issue naming the function and the
                        object, because the body is raw, dialect-specific warehouse
                        SQL, opaque to ThoughtSpot's query planner. A call
                        that would carry a runtime ThoughtSpot parameter is refused
                        outright — it cannot resolve to static SQL, so it is not
                        portable in either direction, and the caller must route it
                        elsewhere (a THOUGHTSPOT-only dialect entry) instead of
                        obtaining a formula string from this function. Pass
                        `partition_column` when the passthrough carries a
                        `PARTITION BY` and the wrapped result guarantees that column
                        reaches ThoughtSpot's GROUP BY regardless of what the user's
                        search selects — enforced by a template/kwarg cross-check in
                        both directions, not left to caller convention.
- `emit_unmappable`  — no formula exists; raises an ERROR issue and returns nothing
                        (the two-bucket rule: never a silent drop — the caller is
                        responsible for preserving the construct in custom_extensions).

Two details that are easy to get subtly wrong (both pinned by tests in test_emit.py):

- `emit_passthrough` does NOT substitute `args` into the SQL body. The body is
  rendered as a quoted *template string*, followed by the arguments as separate
  `sql_*_op` positional arguments — ThoughtSpot resolves the `{0}`, `{1}`, ...
  placeholders itself at formula-evaluation time. Substituting them here would
  produce a formula that looks right and is wrong.
- `emit_direct` DOES substitute positionally (via `str.format`), and rejects an
  argument-count mismatch rather than silently dropping or reusing an argument,
  which would compute the wrong thing while still importing cleanly.

    `has_parameter=True` refuses the call outright: a `sql_*_op` whose

    is not portable in either direction. The caller must not obtain a formula
    string from this function in that case — it routes the construct to a
    THOUGHTSPOT-only dialect entry instead.

    `partition_column`: when the pass-through's SQL carries a `PARTITION BY`,
    pass the column it partitions on and the result comes back wrapped in
    `group_aggregate ( <passthrough> , query_groups ( ) + { <partition_column> } ,
    query_filters ( ) )`, so the partition column reaches ThoughtSpot's GROUP BY
    even when the user's search omits it. This is enforced, not left to caller
    convention: a template that carries `PARTITION BY` (case-insensitive) but no
    `partition_column` raises, and a `partition_column` supplied for a template
    with no `PARTITION BY` raises too — a miscopied catalog row fails
    loudly here instead of silently emitting an unwrapped, only-sometimes-
    correct pass-through.

    The exemplar convention: not every `construct.template` this function renders is a
    complete, general-purpose body. Roughly a third of the catalog's PASSTHROUGH rows
    (`PERCENTILE_CONT`/`DISC`'s `0.75`, `APPROX_PERCENTILE`'s `0.5`, `NTILE`'s `4`,
    `NTH_VALUE`'s `2`, `LAG`/`LEAD`'s offset `1`, `TO_TIMESTAMP`/`TO_CHAR`'s fixed formats,
    `DENSE_RANK`/`CUME_DIST`'s fixed `ORDER BY`, typed literals, and window aggregation's
    `SUM`, among others) bake ONE caller-supplied value into the template as a literal
    while still declaring a satisfiable arity, rather than exposing that value as its own
    `{n}` placeholder. This function renders such a row exactly as written — it has no way
    to tell an exemplar from a genuinely complete template, since both pass the arg-count
    check the same way. The catalog holds an exemplar for documentation and testing; a
    caller translating a real occurrence with a different value for that slot must rebuild
    the template for that occurrence rather than reuse the catalog row's rendering
    verbatim. Each exemplar row's `note` names the baked-in value.
