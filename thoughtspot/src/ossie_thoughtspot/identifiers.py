"""Identifier derivation and column-reference rewriting.

ThoughtSpot has one `name` per column, serving as display name, search token and
cross-document key at once. Ossie splits identifier from label, so the
identifier has to be derived — and derivation collides.

**Known limitation — non-Latin scripts, not diacritics.** An
earlier revision of this module documented ASCII-only folding as a stated
boundary rather than fixing it, on the grounds that a transliteration policy
is a product decision. That reasoning holds for *transliteration* (e.g.
Japanese -> romaji) but not for Unicode canonical *decomposition*, which is
stdlib and needs no policy choice. `normalise` now applies NFKD decomposition
first (`unicodedata.normalize("NFKD", s)`), which separates a base letter from
its combining diacritical marks, then drops non-ASCII before the existing
lowercase-and-substitute folding. A character with no ASCII decomposition
under NFKD (Cyrillic, CJK, and similarly non-Latin scripts) is still dropped,
not transliterated, exactly as before — and a name with no ASCII
alphanumerics surviving still raises `ValueError`. The residual limitation is
narrower than before: `"Café"` -> `"cafe"`, `"Ürün"` -> `"urun"`, and
`"Zürich"` -> `"zurich"` now fold correctly, while a CJK-only name (e.g.
`"北京市"`) still raises. There is also a real open question NFKD does not
settle: some accented Latin folds to a *conventional* ASCII expansion rather
than the bare decomposed letter — German `"Müller"` decomposes to `"Muller"`
here, not the conventional `"Mueller"` — and choosing between them is still a
product decision left to a later change.

`normalise` itself still raises on a name with no surviving ASCII alphanumerics --
that has not changed. What changed is who is still allowed to let it propagate.
`tml_to_ossie.py`'s model/field/metric name conversions each catch it and fall
back to a different, still-usable identifier instead (see that module's
`_field_or_metric_identifier` and its model-scope counterpart in `convert`) --
a display name with no ASCII form is common enough for a non-Latin-script
customer that treating it as fatal dropped their entire model's worth of
fields and metrics, not just one name. A caller with no such fallback of its
own is still expected to let the exception propagate.

    Ossie resolves regular identifiers case-insensitively

    only rejects exact-string duplicates, so a case-only difference would
    validate and still be ambiguous.

    That guarantee is delivered by `normalise`, which lowercases -- not by the
    `.casefold()` in `allocate` below. Every candidate is built from
    `normalise(display_name)` and is therefore already lowercase and ASCII by the
    time it is stored, so that call is a no-op on this path and is kept only as a
    belt against `normalise` ever ceasing to lowercase. The place a casefold is
    genuinely load-bearing is `tml_to_ossie._resolve_name_collision`, which

def split_column_ref(ref: str) -> tuple[str, str]:

    Raises if `ref` doesn't match the `[TABLE::Column]` shape at all, and also
    if it is *ambiguous* — rather than silently taking the first delimiter and
    mis-splitting a table or column name that itself contains `::` (e.g. one
    produced by `format_column_ref("A::B", "C")`). Two distinct ambiguity
    shapes are checked: more than one non-overlapping `::` delimiter in the
    whole reference (`str.count` is non-overlapping, which correctly catches
    two separated delimiters), and a captured column that itself starts with
    `:` — the signature of a *run* of three or more consecutive colons,
    which `str.count("::") > 1` cannot see because the run has only one
    non-overlapping match. `format_column_ref("ORDERS:", "Col")` produces
    `"[ORDERS:::Col]"`, which is exactly as ambiguous as
    `format_column_ref("ORDERS", ":Col")` (same string, same encoding
    collision) and must not silently mis-split to `("ORDERS", ":Col")`.
    Whether the right fix is an escaping scheme or a different delimiter is a
    real design question against live ThoughtSpot display names, left to a
    later change; loud failure is the correct interim behaviour.

    A table or column name containing a single `:` round-trips correctly —
    `split_column_ref(format_column_ref("A:B", "x")) == ("A:B", "x")`. The
    table group matches lazily up to the *first* `::`, not a character class
    that excludes colons outright; only a `::` occurring inside either part
    is the genuinely ambiguous case the checks above catch.
