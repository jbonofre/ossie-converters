"""A shallow tokenizer for ThoughtSpot formulas.

Deliberately not a parser. It answers only what the two conversion directions need: is an
expression a single outer call and what are its parts, where are its column references, and
what does it look like with those references rewritten. Building an expression tree would be
the SQL-parser decision this converter does not take — expressions pass through under a
tagged dialect rather than being translated across dialects, matching every other converter
in this repository and the specification's stated default.

Three ThoughtSpot syntax features drive the implementation and are why an off-the-shelf SQL
tokenizer is not usable here: column references are bracketed and doubly-colon-qualified
(`[TABLE::Column]`), grouping uses braces (`{ }`), and a bare bracketed name with no `::` is
a runtime parameter rather than a column.

**Quoting note — doubling works, backslash-escaping is out of scope on purpose.**
ThoughtSpot's own convention for an embedded quote in a string literal is doubling it
(`'it''s'`), and `_scan` handles that correctly even though it has no explicit doubling
case: the character that closes a quote and the character that immediately reopens it are
both reported as quoted, so nothing in between ever reads as outside the literal. A
backslash before a quote is *not* an escape in ThoughtSpot's grammar — it is an ordinary
character — so `'a\'b'` genuinely ends the literal at the escaped quote, and `_scan`
splitting there is correct behaviour for this language, not a bug to fix.

    kind of bug that would surface as a mis-split argument list months later.

    A `[...]` body is an opaque identifier, not code — a quote character inside one (a
    display name like `Manager's Bonus`) is part of the name, not a string delimiter. So
    quote-toggling is suppressed for as long as the innermost open bracket is `[`; a bracket
    stack (not just the depth counter) tracks which opener is innermost so this only applies
    to `[...]`, not `(...)` or `{...}`, and correctly un-suppresses again once that `[`
    closes, however deeply it is nested inside calls. The stack pops only when a closer
    matches the type of its top entry — a mismatched or stray closer leaves the stack

def find_call_names(expression: str) -> list[str]:
    """Every function-call name in `expression`, at any nesting depth, that is
    not also an operator/control-flow keyword — duplicates kept.

    `split_call` deliberately answers only about the single *outer* call — exactly
    what building a rendering around a whole expression needs. This answers a
    different question a safety check needs instead: whether a call with a
    particular name appears *anywhere* inside the expression, however deeply
    nested — `round ( sum ( [T::x] ) , 2 )` has `round` as its outer call but
    `sum` buried one level inside it, and a caller checking only the outer call
    would miss that the expression already aggregates.

    A name is only reported at a genuine call site: immediately followed by `(`,
    not inside a quoted string literal, and not inside the opaque body of a
    `[...]` reference — so a display name or string literal that happens to
    contain text like `sum (` is never mistaken for a real call.

    **What the keyword exclusion actually costs.** A leading run of
    operator/control-flow keyword words (`and`, `or`, `not`, `if`, ...) is
    stripped from a matched run before it is reported: `true and count ( ... )`
    reports `count`, not the bogus "true and count". But `not` and `if` are
    *also* genuine ThoughtSpot catalog function names — the catalog holds
    `not ( expr )` and `if ( ... ) then ...` — and the keyword blocklist cannot
    tell a real call from an operator use of the same word. So a bare
    `not ( [A::x] )` or `if ( ... )` reports **nothing** here, even though it is
    a real call. This is deliberate and unfixed: this function's one caller
    (`_contains_aggregate_call`) only cares about aggregate names, and neither
    `not` nor `if` is one, so the loss costs that caller nothing. A caller with
    a different need could not rely on this function to find every real call.

    **Weaker than `split_call`'s own keyword handling.** `split_call` rejects
    its *whole* candidate the moment *any* word in it is a keyword, wherever
    that word sits, because there its only job is to say whether the entire
    expression is one call — being wrong in either direction there is a
    correctness bug. This function only strips a *leading* run: a keyword
    appearing after a genuine word is not stripped, and the whole multi-word
    run — keyword included — is reported as one (bogus) name instead. For
    example `flag and sum ( x )` reports the single name `"flag and sum"`, not
    `sum` — silently missing the real call. This shape does not arise from
    valid ThoughtSpot formula grammar (a bare word cannot precede `and` like
    that), which is why it is left as is rather than fixed, but it is not the
    guarantee `split_call` makes, and this docstring says so rather than
    implying otherwise.
