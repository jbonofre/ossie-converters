"""Convert a ThoughtSpot Model column into an Ossie field.

A ThoughtSpot Model `columns[]` entry becomes an Ossie field when it declares
`column_type: ATTRIBUTE`. A `MEASURE` column belongs to a metric instead, converted
elsewhere — this module returns `None` for one rather than building a field that would
duplicate the metric conversion.

Four properties of the mapping are easy to get subtly wrong, because getting them wrong
still produces a document that imports and looks plausible.

The formula string carried in the THOUGHTSPOT dialect entry is the exact `expr` text from
the source document, untouched — never rebuilt from a parsed name/arguments shape. The
reverse direction reads this entry, and the two are compared by exact string equality, so
any reformatting here — even whitespace-only — breaks that comparison on the way back,
regardless of how well the rest of the conversion went.

A portable ANSI_SQL sibling is only ever added next to that verbatim entry, and only when
it can be produced with certainty rather than a guess: a bare column reference is the one
shape handled here. Anything else — a function call, an expression combining several
references, a reference this document's resolver cannot place — is left as
THOUGHTSPOT-only, with an issue recording why, rather than emitting a translation nobody
checked.

A field's identifier and its display label are two different values. `name` is a
normalised, portable identifier derived from the ThoughtSpot column's display name;
`label` carries that display name exactly as written. Writing the display name into
`name`, or the normalised form into `label`, silently breaks both. When the display
name has no ASCII form at all for `identifiers.normalise` to fold onto (a CJK-only,
Cyrillic-only, or Greek-only name), `name` falls back to a different, still-usable
identifier instead of raising — see `_field_or_metric_identifier` — while `label`
still carries the exact original, unaffected either way.

Finally, a computed column is model-scoped in ThoughtSpot but has to live inside exactly
one dataset in Ossie. It is attributed to the dataset every one of its column references
resolves to. When those references disagree — two or more different datasets, one that
cannot be resolved at all, or none at all to go on — no dataset is obviously correct, so
none is guessed: the attribution fails, an issue records why, and the field is not built.
Preserving the formula for a caller's model-level stash is that caller's job from there —
this module only sees one column at a time and has no access to the enclosing document.

A `MEASURE` column becomes a metric instead of a field, built by `convert_metric` below.
Its one genuinely tricky rule is easy to get backwards in a way that still imports cleanly
and produces wrong numbers: the surfacing column's `aggregation` is load-bearing on a
`column_id` metric and on a *scalar*-formula metric (the two compose — `AGG(<scalar
expr>)`, never the bare scalar) but a no-op on a formula whose own outer call already
aggregates (`sum ( ... )`, `group_aggregate ( ... )`, ...) — a common, correct shape
ThoughtSpot's UI produces routinely, so discarding a redundant column aggregation there
is silent by design. Composing when the rule says no-op, or leaving bare when the rule
says compose, silently changes the grain the metric evaluates at while the model still
imports. There is a third, rarer case an outer-call check alone cannot see: an aggregate
*nested inside* a still-scalar outer call, as in `round ( sum ( ... ) , 2 )` — `round` is
not itself an aggregate, but the expression as a whole already is one. That case is the
one worth a warning, because it is the one shape where a reader might reasonably expect
composition and not get it. `_outer_call_is_aggregate` decides the first two cases;
`_contains_aggregate_call` — checked only once the outer call is not itself an aggregate —
decides the third. Both read ThoughtSpot's aggregate call names off the same expression
catalog `_compose_aggregate_entries` uses to build the composed rendering — one source for
every one of these jobs, so they cannot silently drift apart the way independently
hand-typed lists
could. And unlike a field, a metric has no `label`: when identifier normalisation changes the
identifier, the exact display name has nowhere to go but the `custom_extensions` stash.

    The common case is `identifiers.normalise(display_name)`, unchanged. The
    exceptional case — `display_name` has no ASCII alphanumerics for
    `normalise` to fold onto (a CJK-only, Cyrillic-only, Greek-only, or
    punctuation-only name) — used to propagate as `ValueError` out of
    `convert_field`/`convert_metric` entirely, caught by `convert()`'s own
    try/except and misreported as a malformed *column reference* (the
    exception is the same type `identifiers.split_column_ref` raises for a
    genuinely ambiguous reference, and `convert()` could not tell the two
    apart from outside). That also meant the column was dropped rather than
    converted — the same graceful-degradation gap `TS-MODEL-NAME-UNNORMALISABLE`
    already closed at Model scope, here extended to Field/Metric scope, and
    reported under its own code so the two failures are never conflated again.

    The fallback identifier, in preference order:

    1. `physical_hint` — normally the underlying warehouse column's own
       `db_column_name` (see `_physical_db_column_name`), for a
       column_id-backed column. A warehouse identifier is almost always
       ASCII even when the display name labelling it is not, and it is
       unique within its own table by construction (two columns cannot
       share one warehouse name) — so no collision-avoidance is needed for
       this branch; it is naturally distinct the same way an ordinary,
       successfully-normalised identifier is (this converter does not
       collision-check those either, a pre-existing and separate gap — see
       `_index_attribute_columns`).
    2. A fixed placeholder — `kind` itself, i.e. `"field"` or `"metric"` —
       allocated through `allocator`. Reached only when there is no
       `physical_hint` at all (a formula-backed column with no physical
       grounding) or the hint itself also has no ASCII form. `allocator` is
       shared by the caller across every column that can reach this branch,
       so two columns that would otherwise both become `"field"` instead
       become `"field"` and `"field_2"` — distinct, per the `Allocator`
       collision-suffix contract in `identifiers.py`.

    Either fallback always differs from `display_name`, so a caller that
    already stashes the original display name whenever the identifier
    differs from it (metrics do; fields carry it in `label` instead, which
    is populated independently of this call and needs no stash) picks this
    case up for free — nothing here writes a stash entry itself, only logs
    the WARNING naming what happened.

    is treated as `NONE` and logged — the value was present and could not be
    understood, which is a loss worth reporting, unlike an absent `aggregation` key,
    which defaults to `NONE` silently.

    Metrics have no `label` field (unlike fields): when identifier normalisation changes
    the identifier, the exact ThoughtSpot display name is stashed as `tml_name`
    rather than carried in a dedicated field.

    Which of the three TML shapes produced this metric — `column_aggregation`,
    `scalar_formula_plus_aggregation`, or `formula` — is stashed as `shape`, so a
    return trip can reproduce the source shape instead of collapsing all three
    into one. `formula` is omitted rather than written: it is also what a
    document with no stash defaults to on the way back, so writing it would
    change nothing about the reconstruction while making the payload heavier.

    `allocator` is `convert_field`'s own parameter, mirrored here — see its
    docstring. Metrics are model-scoped in Ossie (unlike fields, scoped per
    dataset), so `convert()` shares a *different* `Allocator` across metrics
    than it does across fields; a caller that omits it gets a fresh, private
    one, correct for a call that only ever converts one column.

# built first (so their names -- the model_tables[] alias-or-name, never
# normalised -- are known), then `resolve` is a closure over that, then
# fields and metrics are converted through it, then joins become
# relationships, then keys are derived from the relationships that qualify.
#
# A malformed reference anywhere in a TML document (an ambiguous `column_id`
# or join condition -- `identifiers.split_column_ref` raising on purpose
# rather than mis-splitting) is caught per object: the object is skipped, an
# issue names it, and the rest of the model still converts. Nothing here lets
# one bad reference abort the whole conversion.

    """`{(TABLE, physical column display name)}`, for every ATTRIBUTE
    `columns[]` entry bound to a valid physical `column_id`.

    This is the set `resolve()` gates cross-references against: a bare
    `[TABLE::Column]` reference is portable only when it names a column the
    model actually surfaces as a field. It has to be built ahead of Phase 3
    (fields and metrics) because a formula processed early in that phase can
    reference a column defined later in the same `columns[]` list -- the gate
    needs to already know about every ATTRIBUTE column, not just the ones
    converted so far.

    Membership only -- no identifier value. An earlier revision stored
    `identifiers.normalise(column["name"])` as the value here, on the theory
    that `resolve()`'s caller needed to know the field's actual identifier
    up front. It didn't: every real consumer of the value only ever tested
    membership (see `resolve()` in `convert()`), and the one place that did
    read the *value* (Phase 3.5's `sql_output_columns` stash) now reads
    `built_field_names`, populated from the field `convert_field` actually
    built, in `convert()`'s Phase 3 -- the one place that identifier is
    truly known, rather than a second, independent recomputation of it here
    that had to somehow stay in exact sync. That sync was already fragile
    (see the note on `convert_field`'s own `allocator` parameter) and it
    silently broke the moment a column's display name failed to normalise:
    this index used to drop such a column from the gate entirely, on the
    theory that `convert_field` would drop the field too -- true before
    `convert_field` grew a fallback identifier, and a real correctness bug
    once it did, because a cross-reference to that column then resolved to
    nothing even though the field genuinely exists, and the column's own
    physical entry was reported as unsurfaced despite having a real field.
    Tracking membership only, independent of how the identifier is derived,
    closes both without needing the two call sites to agree on anything.

    A malformed `column_id` is caught here, per column, rather than aborting
    the whole model: the column is left out of the index -- any expression
    that references it resolves to nothing, which every caller already
    treats as an ordinary unresolved reference -- and an issue names it.

    the same choice `_unconsumed_properties` already makes for column

    """One `model_tables[].joins[]` entry -> `(relationship,
    unrepresentable_entry, key_candidate)`.

    Handles both TML join shapes: `inline` (fully defined here -- `with`/
    `on`/`type`/`cardinality`) and `referencing` (`referencing_join` names an
    entry in the *Table*'s own `joins_with[]`, which supplies `destination`/
    `on`/`type`/`cardinality`; a `type`/`cardinality` also present on this
    entry overrides the Table's and marks the shape
    `referencing_with_inline_attrs`, the real hybrid the 2026-07-30 census
    found on 12 of 493 joins).

    `known_datasets` is checked against the resolved target the same way the
    caller already checks the source before calling this at all: a target
    naming a dataset this model never built -- a table document missing, a
    duplicate alias, or simply a typo -- is dropped with a WARNING rather
    than emitted. Upstream's own validator hard-fails a document with a
    relationship pointing at an unknown dataset (`exit 1`, not a warning),
    so emitting one anyway would make the *whole* document unusable by any
    downstream tool that runs it; dropping the one broken relationship keeps
    everything else in the model valid and usable, which is the more useful
    failure of the two.

    The cardinality-orientation rule itself is applied inside
    `_relationship_from_join`, not here: a `ONE_TO_MANY` join's endpoints are
    swapped there so the *emitted* relationship's `from`/`to` always lands on
    the many-side/one-side arrangement core-spec/spec.yaml requires,
    regardless of which side TML happened to declare the join from. Because
    that swap already happened by the time `relationship` comes back here,
    the key candidate handed to `keys.derive_keys` is read directly off the
    (possibly-swapped) `relationship["to"]`/`relationship["to_columns"]` --
    for a swapped `ONE_TO_MANY` join this is TML's original FROM side (now
    the relationship's `to`), which is exactly the side a key belongs to;
    for every other cardinality it is unchanged from before, since nothing
    swapped. Only the cardinality label itself still needs translating:
    `keys._qualifies` recognises `MANY_TO_ONE`/`ONE_TO_ONE`, never the TML
    spelling `ONE_TO_MANY` a swapped relationship is still stashed under, so
    `ONE_TO_MANY` is relabelled `MANY_TO_ONE` for the candidate. `MANY_TO_MANY`
    needs no such handling -- it is excluded by `keys._qualifies` on either
    side, which is already correct.
