"""TML's structural half: the 1+N document set, and the serialisation invariants.

Deliberately holds no Ossie vocabulary — it is the ThoughtSpot file format and nothing else,
which is what makes it unit-testable without a fixture from the other side.

Three invariants are ENFORCED here so no caller has to carry them, and a fourth is
supported here and applied by the caller. `guid` is read and never written,
at any depth: it belongs at the document root, and a nested one — anywhere in the body, not
only there — is *silently ignored* on import while ThoughtSpot creates a duplicate object
with the same name. Tables are emitted before the model, which references
each one by name, so ordering is load-bearing. And everything goes through the YAML 1.2 codec
so a column, synonym, or parameter value of `on`, `off`, `yes`, or `no` survives as the string
it is instead of being coerced to a boolean.

The fourth is the block scalar: a formula expression containing braces must be emitted as
a `>-` block scalar or the YAML will not parse on re-read. This module supplies the
mechanism (`block_scalar`) but does not decide when it applies -- that lives in
`ossie_to_thoughtspot._maybe_block_scalar`, its only caller. So it is the one rule on this
list a caller CAN still get wrong.

Filenames minted for a document set are sanitised and length-capped: a table name is
user-controlled data and may contain characters a filesystem treats specially — a path
separator, a `..` component, a Windows-reserved device name, more bytes than a single path
component allows — so `dump_document_set` never writes one through unexamined, and never
lets two documents land on the same filename.
