"""Build a ThoughtSpot Table or SQL View TML document from one Ossie dataset.

An Ossie semantic model becomes 1+N TML documents: one Model document plus one
Table (or SQL View) document per dataset. The Model references each table by
name, so the tables have to exist first — this module builds the "N" half.
Building the Model document itself (formulas, surfaced columns, joins) is a
separate module, because deciding which of a dataset's fields become a
physical column here versus a Model formula there needs the same test either
way: a field whose expression is a single, unqualified column reference is
physical; anything else — a function call, an operator, several references —
is computed and has no physical column to hold it. Only the first kind is
handled here.

Two things are unrecoverable *from the field's own expression alone*, and
both are handled by falling back to a documented default rather than
guessing, with the fallback always reported:

* **The warehouse column's own physical name, for a field that came from a
  real ThoughtSpot table.** A round-tripped field's bracketed reference
  (e.g. ``[ORDERS::Order Date]``) carries the table column's *display* name
  only, not its own `db_column_name` — a Model's `column_id` is matched by
  display name, never by warehouse name. When the two genuinely differed,
  the forward direction now stashes the true warehouse name separately
  (`FIELD_STASH_DB_COLUMN_NAME`, Table-backed columns only), and that value
  is used whenever present. Only when it is genuinely absent — a
  hand-authored bracket, or a document produced before this key existed —
  does this fall back to assuming the display name and the warehouse name
  agree, which is correct in the common case and is reported as an
  assumption otherwise, because a wrong guess here names a column the
  warehouse may not have. A hand-authored field instead carries a bare,
  unqualified SQL identifier for its own physical column (e.g.
  ``order_date``), which genuinely *is* its warehouse name, not a stand-in
  for one, so no assumption or issue is needed there. Either way,
  ``db_column_name`` is written — always, even when it is identical to the
  column's display name, because some ThoughtSpot instances reject an import
  that omits it.
* **Whether an Ossie `Time` field's underlying warehouse column is really a
  full timestamp.** The datatype map gives `Time` a conditional mapping —
  `VARCHAR` normally, `DATE_TIME` when the column is timestamp-backed — but
  that condition needs a fact this module has no way to observe. A `Time`
  value can only ever reach this function from a hand-authored document in
  the first place: the forward direction never emits `Time` at all (nothing
  round-trips into it), so there is never a stashed ThoughtSpot column behind
  it to inspect, and an Ossie `Field` carries no storage-format signal
  besides `datatype` itself. There is nothing here to condition on, so the
  unconditional default (`VARCHAR`) is what gets written, and the datatype's
  declared loss is still reported so the choice is visible rather than silent.

    a matching `joins_with[]` entry for the caller to attach to the *Table*
    document -- whenever the stashed `referencing_join` name still matches
    this relationship's own current `name`. TML's inline join syntax has no
    name field at all, so a relationship that instead falls through to the
    inline branch below gets a fresh one synthesized from its own from/to
    dataset names on the next TML -> Ossie pass; restoring the referencing
    shape here is what avoids that rename. When the two names disagree --
    the relationship was renamed since the stash was written -- the stash
    is stale: it is dropped, an issue records it, and the join is emitted
    inline instead, exactly as a hand-authored relationship with no stash
    at all would be. The same is true when there is no stashed
    `referencing_join` to begin with.

    The witness-copy pattern governs `on_expression` here, named by example
    elsewhere in this converter as the "verbatim on_expression" case. A plain
    stash-if-present read would silently keep
    serving the *old* condition (residual predicates included) after a user
    retargets the relationship's `from_columns`/`to_columns` -- so the stash
    is only trusted when the witness (a snapshot of those two arrays, taken
    the moment the stash was written) still matches the live ones. A mismatch
    means the relationship was edited since; the stash -- on_expression and
    whatever residual narrowing it carried -- is dropped, an issue records
    it, and the condition is re-derived from the current from_columns/
    to_columns alone, exactly as a hand-authored relationship with no stash
    at all would be.

    The same witness pattern governs whether this relationship's endpoints
    get un-swapped before any of the above runs. `TML -> Ossie` swaps a
    `ONE_TO_MANY` join's `from`/`to`/`from_columns`/`to_columns` so the
    emitted relationship satisfies core-spec/spec.yaml's many-side/one-side
    convention (see `tml_to_ossie._relationship_from_join`) -- which means
    recovering TML's own declared join direction here means undoing that
    swap first, before `from_prefix`/`to_prefix`/`from_columns`/`to_columns`
    are used for anything else in this function (the condition fallback, the
    `with`/`destination` target, and the `from_prefix` the caller nests the
    join under). The swap is undone only while
    `RELATIONSHIP_STASH_ENDPOINTS_SWAPPED_WITNESS` still matches the
    relationship's live from/to/from_columns/to_columns -- agreement means
    nobody retargeted the relationship since the stash was written;
    disagreement means it was, so the swap is left alone (the live shape is
    trusted as-is, exactly as a hand-authored relationship with no stash at
    all would be) and an issue records it.
