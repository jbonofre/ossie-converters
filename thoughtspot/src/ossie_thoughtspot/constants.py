VENDOR_KEY and DIALECT hold the same string today and are deliberately separate

merged (see DIALECT_IS_REGISTERED).

VENDOR_KEY = "THOUGHTSPOT"

#: Expression-language dialect label. A registered member of the Ossie Dialect enum.
DIALECT = "THOUGHTSPOT"

#: apache/ossie#351 merged 2026-09-01: THOUGHTSPOT is now in the closed `Dialect`

#: The exact `version` this converter writes at the root of every document it
#: emits (`{"version": DOCUMENT_VERSION, "name": ..., "datasets": [...]}`). Unlike
#: SPEC_SERIES (major.minor, used to check an *incoming* document's rough
#: compatibility), ossie-schema.json pins `version` to this exact string as a

#:
#: Here rather than beside the reverse inventory that first recorded them,
#: because BOTH directions need them and for different jobs: the reverse
#: inventory composes them into windowed SQL, and `tml_to_ossie` must recognise
#: them as *already aggregated* so it does not compose a metric's own

#: Field/metric-level custom_extensions[THOUGHTSPOT] key holding the

#: when it differs from the column's display name (Table-backed columns
#: only -- a SQL View's own sql_output_columns dataset-level key already
#: covers the same fact). Not yet in the pinned payload schema. Shared here,
#: rather than written as a literal in each direction separately, because
#: tml_to_ossie.py (the writer) and ossie_to_thoughtspot.py (the reader)
#: must agree on the exact spelling and nothing else enforces that.
FIELD_STASH_DB_COLUMN_NAME = "db_column_name"

#: Formulas present in `model.formulas[]` that NO `columns[]` entry surfaces --
#: internal helpers, referenced by other formulas but not exposed to users. A
#: date-parameter model is the common case: `_startDate`, `_endDate` and the
#: like compute a window that the visible formulas then use.
#:
#: They were dropped outright: the converter walks `columns[]`, so a formula no
#: column surfaces is never visited at all, and even the unattributed-formula
#: stash only catches ones that WERE visited and could not be attributed. In one
#: real model that was 32 of 41 formulas -- and the 9 visible ones that
#: referenced them came back with dangling `[formula__startDate]` references, so
#: the emitted document would not import.
#:
#: Stashed with their `id`, because that is what the surviving references name.
#: Restored as `formulas[]` entries with NO surfacing column, which is what they
#: were: giving them one would make an internal helper user-visible.
MODEL_STASH_UNSURFACED_FORMULAS = "unsurfaced_formulas"

#: A surfacing column's `aggregation` that is LOAD-BEARING and has no home in
#: the Ossie metric's own expression, so it is preserved verbatim instead.
#:
#: The one shape this is for: a formula whose outer call is a BARE
#: `group_aggregate ( ... )`. Every other already-aggregating shape makes the
#: column's aggregation a genuine no-op -- `sum ( ... )`, and the
#: `group_sum`/`group_average` shorthands, all behave that way (verified on a
#: live cluster: a model carrying `sum([SALES])` WITH `aggregation: SUM`
#: returns the same number as the source). A bare `group_aggregate` does not:
#: like a raw column, ThoughtSpot may APPLY the column aggregation to it. It
#: was being discarded with the others and with nothing logged, which silently
#: changes the number.
METRIC_STASH_COLUMN_AGGREGATION = "column_aggregation_value"

#: The source TML `obj_id` -- ThoughtSpot's own PORTABLE object handle, e.g.
#: `SampleRetail-Apparel-LH-58435d2b` (display name, then the first segment of
#: the GUID). Stashed under a distinct payload key so the forbidden-key scan,
#: which looks for a literal `obj_id`, does not mistake this deliberate copy for
#: leaked identity.
#:
#: Why this is kept when `guid` and `fqn` are not, though all three were once
#: grouped as "instance-local identity": they are not the same kind of thing.
#: `guid` is a raw cluster UUID and `fqn` is a reference to one -- and a
#: viz-level `fqn` is DROPPED on import, leaving the object with no data source.
#: `obj_id` is the identifier ThoughtSpot introduced precisely so objects can be
#: referenced across environments, and it survives import. Discarding it meant a
#: converted model re-imported as a NEW object rather than updating the one it
#: came from, which is the ordinary promote-between-environments workflow.
MODEL_STASH_OBJ_ID = "tml_obj_id"

#: The source TML `formulas[].id` of a computed field or metric, stashed
#: verbatim. TML's `formulas[].id` and `formulas[].name` are INDEPENDENT -- a
#: formula renamed after creation keeps its original id -- but the Ossie -> TML
#: leg mints ids from display names and so resolved a verbatim `[formula_X]`
#: cross-reference by matching X against normalised NAMES. When some other
#: formula's name normalised to the referenced id's tail, the reference
#: silently followed it: a metric defined as `(sum(a) - sum(b)) + 1` came back
#: as `(sum(a) * 0.5) + 1`, exit 0, nothing logged. Preserving the id is what
#: makes the binding survive; matching on names can only ever approximate it.
FIELD_STASH_FORMULA_ID = "formula_id"

#: The witness copy for FIELD_STASH_DB_COLUMN_NAME: the physical column's
#: own display name (the bracket's column part, e.g. "Amount") as it stood
#: the moment db_column_name was stashed. Ossie -> TML compares this against
#: the CURRENT bracket reference's column part: agreement means nobody
#: retargeted the field to a different physical column since, so the
#: stashed warehouse name is still trustworthy; disagreement means the
#: field now names a different column and the stashed warehouse name
#: describes the wrong one -- it is dropped rather than misapplied to the
#: new column.
FIELD_STASH_DB_COLUMN_NAME_WITNESS = "db_column_name_display_name_witness"

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# The rest of the custom_extensions[THOUGHTSPOT] payload vocabulary.
#
# Every name below is a key of the JSON object stash.write_stash serialises
# and stash.read_stash parses back -- the same channel FIELD_STASH_DB_COLUMN_NAME
# above already covers for one key. tml_to_ossie.py (the writer) and
# ossie_to_thoughtspot.py (the reader) must agree on each spelling exactly, and
# nothing but this module enforces that; several of these are, today, written
# by only one side (tml_to_ossie.py has no Model/Metric-reading counterpart yet
# in ossie_to_thoughtspot.py) -- they are named here anyway so the reader that
# is eventually written consumes the same literal, not a freshly retyped guess.
#
# Grouped by which Ossie object each key's custom_extensions entry attaches to
# -- Model, Dataset, Relationship, or Field/Metric -- because that grouping is
# itself part of the payload's schema (see the design doc's SemanticModelLevel /
# DatasetLevel / RelationshipLevel / FieldLevel / MetricLevel $defs).
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

#: Exact ThoughtSpot display name, stashed whenever identifier normalisation produced
#: a different Ossie identifier. Shared across every scope that can suffer
#: this divergence: Model (the document root's `name`) and Metric (a Metric has no
#: `label` field to carry the display name the way a Field does). Also
#: defensively checked at Dataset scope by `_table_name` in
#: ossie_to_thoughtspot.py -- but a Dataset's own `name` is the verbatim
#: model_tables[] alias-or-name and is never run through normalisation, so
#: nothing writes this key there today; that check is symmetry with the other
#: two scopes, not a reachable path.
STASH_TML_NAME = "tml_name"

# --- Model scope (attached to the document root) ---------------------------

#: Formula-backed ATTRIBUTE columns whose references span two or more
#: datasets, so no single Ossie dataset can own the field. Preserved verbatim
#: (each entry carries at least `name`, `formula_name` and `expr`) alongside
#: an issue.
MODEL_STASH_UNATTRIBUTED_FORMULAS = "unattributed_formulas"

#: The formula's OWN TML `name`, stashed on a MODEL_STASH_UNATTRIBUTED_FORMULAS
#: entry alongside the surfacing column's display name (that entry's plain
#: `name` key). The two are independent in TML: a formula's `name` and the
#: `name` of the column that surfaces it can differ, and the return leg
#: needs BOTH for different reasons: the column's display name is what a user
#: sees and must come back under, while the formula's own name is what a
#: SIBLING formula's `[formula_X]` cross-reference is normalised against on
#: import (`_rewrite_formula_references`'s name-fallback path). Restoring
#: only the column's display name (as the column's #468 fix does) fixes the
#: column but re-registers the formula's cross-reference identity under the
#: wrong text, so a second formula referencing the first by its original
#: name silently stops resolving. No Ossie counterpart: Ossie has no
#: standalone "formula's own name" concept independent of the field/column
#: that surfaces it, so nothing on that side can diverge from this value.
FIELD_STASH_FORMULA_NAME = "formula_name"

#: Joins with no equality pair at all (a pure range or pure constant
#: condition), which cannot become a Relationship because Ossie's
#: `from_columns`/`to_columns` are required and non-empty. Preserved
#: verbatim, alongside an issue. Each entry reuses the RELATIONSHIP_STASH_*
#: keys below for the facts a real Relationship's own custom_extensions
#: entry would have carried, since it describes the same kind of TML join.
MODEL_STASH_UNREPRESENTABLE_JOINS = "unrepresentable_joins"

#: ThoughtSpot Model-only properties with no Ossie equivalent

MODEL_STASH_CONSTRAINTS = "constraints"

#: Verbatim Model-level `joins_with[]` data-augmentation joins. Named
#: "model_" rather than reusing the bare TML key `joins_with` because a
#: *Table* document has its own, differently-scoped `joins_with[]`
#: (referencing-join definitions) -- the two must not collide under one
#: stash key.
MODEL_STASH_MODEL_JOINS_WITH = "model_joins_with"

# --- Dataset scope (attached to a `datasets[]` entry) -----------------------

#: Whether the source TML document was a `table:` or a `sql_view:` --
#: authoritative over `_derive_kind`'s own whitespace/dotted-identifier
#: heuristic whenever present, since it also determines which shape
#: `unsurfaced_columns` was captured in.
DATASET_STASH_TML_OBJECT = "tml_object"

#: The witness copy for DATASET_STASH_TML_OBJECT: the dataset's own
#: `source` string as it stood the moment `tml_object` was stashed.
#: Ossie -> TML compares this against the CURRENT `source`: agreement means
#: nobody edited it since (a query rewritten as a table reference, or vice
#: versa), so the stashed kind is still trustworthy; disagreement means the
#: stash is stale and `_derive_kind` re-guesses from the current `source`
#: instead of trusting a kind that used to describe a different value.
DATASET_STASH_TML_OBJECT_WITNESS = "tml_object_source_witness"

DATASET_STASH_ALIAS = "alias"

DATASET_STASH_CONNECTION_NAME = "connection_name"

#: `db`/`schema`/`db_table` recorded individually when the dotted `source`

DATASET_STASH_UNSURFACED_COLUMNS = "unsurfaced_columns"

DATASET_STASH_TABLE_PROPERTIES = "table_properties"

# --- Relationship scope (attached to a `relationships[]` entry) ------------
#
# Also reused, unchanged, inside MODEL_STASH_UNREPRESENTABLE_JOINS entries --
# a join that could not become a Relationship at all still needs the same
# facts recorded, under the same names, because it is the same kind of TML
# join fact either way.

#: ThoughtSpot's join-type vocabulary (`INNER`, `LEFT_OUTER`, `RIGHT_OUTER`,
#: `OUTER`), identical in a Model inline join and a Table `joins_with[]` entry.
RELATIONSHIP_STASH_TYPE = "type"

#: ThoughtSpot's join cardinality (`MANY_TO_ONE`, `ONE_TO_ONE`, `ONE_TO_MANY`,
#: `MANY_TO_MANY`). Always the exact TML value, verbatim, regardless of
#: whether `RELATIONSHIP_STASH_ENDPOINTS_SWAPPED` (below) also fired for this
#: relationship -- the two facts are independent: this one is never stale
#: (TML's cardinality has no Ossie-side counterpart to disagree with), while
#: whether the endpoint swap it triggered is still trustworthy is a separate,
#: witnessed question.
RELATIONSHIP_STASH_CARDINALITY = "cardinality"

#: Whether this relationship's `from`/`to`/`from_columns`/`to_columns` were
#: swapped relative to TML's own declared join direction. core-spec/spec.yaml
#: requires a Relationship's `from` to name the many side and `to` the one
#: side, but TML's `from`/`to` (the model_tables[] entry a join is declared
#: under, and its `with`/`destination` target) do not themselves encode which
#: side is which -- `cardinality` does. Only a `ONE_TO_MANY` join has TML's
#: `from` naming the one side and `to` naming the many side -- the wrong way
#: around for Ossie's spec -- so only that cardinality ever sets this `True`
#: and swaps the emitted relationship's endpoints to compensate. `MANY_TO_ONE`
#: and `ONE_TO_ONE` are already oriented correctly and never set it.
RELATIONSHIP_STASH_ENDPOINTS_SWAPPED = "endpoints_swapped"

#: The witness copy for RELATIONSHIP_STASH_ENDPOINTS_SWAPPED: `[from, to,
#: from_columns, to_columns]` exactly as emitted -- i.e. already swapped --
#: at the moment the marker was stashed. `Ossie -> TML` compares this against
#: the relationship's CURRENT `from`/`to`/`from_columns`/`to_columns`:
#: agreement means nobody retargeted the relationship since, so it is safe to
#: undo the swap and recover the TML join's original `from`/`to`/columns
#: (and, with them, which dataset's `model_tables[]` entry the join is
#: nested under); disagreement means the relationship was edited since the
#: stash was written, so the swap is not undone -- the live shape is trusted
#: instead, exactly as a hand-authored relationship with no stash at all
#: would be -- and an issue records it.
RELATIONSHIP_STASH_ENDPOINTS_SWAPPED_WITNESS = "endpoints_swapped_witness"

#: Which TML join shape produced this relationship -- `"referencing"` (a
#: named Table `joins_with[]` entry the Model points at), `"inline"` (defined
#: directly in `model_tables[].joins[]`), or `"referencing_with_inline_attrs"`
#: (both: a `referencing_join` plus a `type`/`cardinality` override).
RELATIONSHIP_STASH_JOIN_SHAPE = "join_shape"

#: The Table `joins_with[]` entry name, when `join_shape` is `"referencing"`
#: (or the hybrid).
RELATIONSHIP_STASH_REFERENCING_JOIN = "referencing_join"

#: The verbatim join condition. Required whenever the condition is not a
#: pure equality (range / ASOF / constant joins), because `from_columns`/
#: `to_columns` then carry only part of it.
RELATIONSHIP_STASH_ON_EXPRESSION = "on_expression"

#: The witness copy for `RELATIONSHIP_STASH_ON_EXPRESSION`: `[from_columns,
#: to_columns]` exactly as they stood the moment `on_expression` was
#: stashed (only ever written alongside it, i.e. only when residual
#: predicates exist). `Ossie -> TML` compares this against the relationship's
#: CURRENT `from_columns`/`to_columns` -- agreement means nobody retargeted
#: the relationship since the stash was written, so the verbatim
#: `on_expression` (and the residual narrowing it carries) is still current
#: and is restored; disagreement means the stash is stale, so both are
#: dropped and the plain equality condition is re-derived from the live
#: from_columns/to_columns instead, with an issue recording it. This is one of
#: the FIVE witness copies this converter keeps -- the others being
#: FIELD_STASH_DB_COLUMN_NAME_WITNESS, DATASET_STASH_TML_OBJECT_WITNESS,
#: RELATIONSHIP_STASH_ENDPOINTS_SWAPPED_WITNESS and FIELD_STASH_DATA_TYPE_WITNESS.
#: What this one witnesses: "a relationship's verbatim on_expression".
RELATIONSHIP_STASH_ON_EXPRESSION_WITNESS = "on_expression_equality_witness"

# --- Field/metric scope (attached to a `fields[]` or `metrics[]` entry) -----
#
# FIELD_STASH_DB_COLUMN_NAME above is the original of this group; the rest
# follow its naming even though, like it, they are written for a Metric just
# as often as for a Field -- `_physical_column_stash` and
# `_unconsumed_properties` in tml_to_ossie.py build both keys identically
# regardless of which of the two the caller is converting.

#: The exact ThoughtSpot `db_column_properties.data_type` spelling, recorded
#: only when it is not the canonical spelling `datatypes.to_tml` would emit
#: by default for the Ossie datatype (`BOOLEAN` vs `BOOL`, `FLOAT` vs
#: `DOUBLE`), so the return trip re-emits the same one.
FIELD_STASH_DATA_TYPE = "data_type"

#: The witness copy for FIELD_STASH_DATA_TYPE: the Ossie `datatype` value
#: (`"Boolean"` or `"Float"` -- the only two `_CANONICAL_TML_SPELLING` ever
#: stashes a non-canonical spelling for) as it stood the moment the spelling
#: was recorded. `Ossie -> TML` compares this against the field's CURRENT
#: `datatype`: agreement means nobody edited the field's declared type since,
#: so the exact warehouse spelling is still trustworthy and is restored;
#: disagreement -- the field now declares a different datatype -- means the
#: spelling is stale (it names a warehouse type for the *old* datatype, not
#: this one) and is dropped, falling back to the canonical spelling
#: `datatypes.to_tml` derives for the current value instead.
FIELD_STASH_DATA_TYPE_WITNESS = "data_type_ossie_datatype_witness"

#: ThoughtSpot column properties this converter did not read and consume

#: preserved rather than silently dropped. Also reused, unchanged, for the
#: `column_properties` an unattributed formula's own source column carried
#: (see MODEL_STASH_UNATTRIBUTED_FORMULAS) -- the same "properties this
#: converter did not otherwise account for" concept, just attached to a

FIELD_STASH_COLUMN_PROPERTIES = "column_properties"

# --- Metric-only scope -------------------------------------------------------

#: Which of the three TML shapes (`column_aggregation`,

#: into one. `formula` is the default a document with no stash at all
#: reconstructs as, so it is the one value never written.
METRIC_STASH_SHAPE = "shape"

#: METRIC_STASH_SHAPE's own value vocabulary -- shared here, not written as a
#: literal by tml_to_ossie.py (the writer) and re-typed as a literal by
#: ossie_to_thoughtspot.py (the reader), for the same reason every other name
#: in this file is centralised: the two must agree on the exact spelling and
#: nothing else enforces that. `METRIC_SHAPE_FORMULA` is also what a document

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Stash-freshness classification.
#
# Every custom_extensions[THOUGHTSPOT] key above answers one question before
# ossie_to_thoughtspot.py is allowed to read it: does the stashed value
# shadow something this converter could otherwise derive from the live Ossie
# document -- a field's own bracket reference, a metric's own name, a
# dataset's own source -- or is it information that exists nowhere else in
# the Ossie document at all?
#
# The first kind can go stale: a user edits the Ossie document (retargets a
# field, renames a metric, rewrites a relationship, rewrites a dataset's
# source) and the stash still describes the document as it was. A key in
# that category needs a witness and a currency check -- reused only
# when the two still agree, dropped and re-derived otherwise -- never plain
# stash-if-present. The second kind cannot go stale, because there is
# nothing on the Ossie side for it to disagree with; plain stash-if-present
# is correct there and a witness would have nothing to compare against.
#
# STASH_KEY_CLASSIFICATION is the enforcement point. Three different stash
# keys were found, independently, reading the unsafe way before this table
# existed (FIELD_STASH_DB_COLUMN_NAME, FIELD_STASH_DATA_TYPE, and a
# relationship's on_expression) — each found by generalising from the
# instance before it, not by a rule anyone consulted. This table is that
# rule, made structural: a key read anywhere in ossie_to_thoughtspot.py that
# is missing here fails test_stash_key_classification.py, so the next key
# has to declare an answer rather than default to the unsafe one. It does
# not, by itself, prove the *code* honours a SHADOWS_DERIVABLE
# classification with an actual witness -- that is still a review
# discipline -- but it makes "someone forgot" a build failure instead of a
# silent gap for a key already known to need one.

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# A second, orthogonal axis StashKeyClass alone cannot express.
#
# StashKeyClass answers one question: can this key's stashed VALUE disagree
# with something the live Ossie document says? DATASET_STASH_UNSURFACED_
# COLUMNS answers that "no" correctly -- a physical column's own
# db_column_name/data_type has no Ossie-side counterpart to check it
# against, so INFORMATION_ONLY is the right answer for its *content*. But a
# key that holds a LIST of entries has a second question INFORMATION_ONLY
# does not cover at all: does each entry still BELONG in the list? For
# unsurfaced_columns specifically, an entry belongs only while no live field
# now covers the same physical column -- and that membership fact changes
# the moment a field is added, or retargeted, onto a column that used to be
# unsurfaced. Restoring a membership-stale entry verbatim (the value itself
# is still perfectly accurate) alongside the live field's own build of the
# same column duplicates it -- a duplicate Table/SQL-View column name, which
# does not import. This was found live: a field retargeted onto a
# previously-unsurfaced column produced exactly that duplicate, undetected
# by the value-only classification above because the value itself was never
# wrong.
#
# So "information-only in value" and "derivable in membership" are
# independent facts about one key, and a single INFORMATION_ONLY /
# SHADOWS_DERIVABLE answer cannot record both. STASH_KEYS_WITH_DERIVABLE_
# MEMBERSHIP is the second axis: a key here is a *list*-shaped stash whose
# entries can be superseded by something the live document now covers, and
# whose read site MUST filter entries against that live coverage before
# appending them -- silently, same as an ordinary derive-instead-of-stash
# fallback, because a filtered-out entry was not lost, just no longer
# needed. Every other list-shaped INFORMATION_ONLY key was checked against
# this question directly, not assumed innocent: DATASET_STASH_SQL_OUTPUT_
# COLUMNS is consulted only as a per-field dict lookup keyed by the live
# field's own name (never appended as a block), so a field no longer
# present just means the lookup is never made -- no duplication is
# possible, and it does not belong here. MODEL_STASH_UNATTRIBUTED_FORMULAS
# and MODEL_STASH_UNREPRESENTABLE_JOINS are appended into collections
# (formulas[]/columns[], and a table's inline joins[]) that already run
# every entry through the shared display-name allocator or accept multiple
# joins between the same pair without an import-breaking collision, so a
# name clash there is caught (and now logged -- see
# TS-MODEL-DISPLAY-NAME-COLLISION) rather than silently duplicated. Every
# scalar-valued INFORMATION_ONLY key (a single string, dict, or bool
# assigned once, never merged with anything else the live document also
# populates) has no membership question to ask at all.
