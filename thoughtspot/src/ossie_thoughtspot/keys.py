"""primary_key / unique_keys derivation.

TML declares no keys, so every key we emit is manufactured from the
join graph. Upstream PR #330 checks that a relationship's to_columns covers a
declared key, and converters/databricks turns a declared key into a
`rely.at_most_one_match` join hint — so a fabricated key becomes another
vendor's wrong numbers, not just a cosmetic error in ours.

Orientation is re-checked downstream, so do not rely on ours surviving.
`converters/databricks` (`ossie_to_metric_view.py:446-478`) swaps `from`/`to`
and their column arrays — via `_warn()` (`ossie_to_metric_view.py:53`), not
silently — when the *from* side covers a key and the *to* side does not,
carrying any `custom_extensions` payload onto the reversed relationship.
