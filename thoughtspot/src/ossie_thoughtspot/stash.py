"""custom_extensions[THOUGHTSPOT] payload handling.

#: `obj_id` is in this scan but is NOT wholly forbidden: the scan stops it
#: riding along unnoticed inside a block copied wholesale from source TML, while
#: `constants.STASH_OBJ_ID` preserves it DELIBERATELY, under its own payload key.
#: The three are not equivalent -- `guid` is a raw cluster UUID and `fqn` a
#: reference to one, but `obj_id` is the handle ThoughtSpot introduced so objects
#: can be referenced ACROSS environments, and unlike an `fqn` it survives import.

    `forbidden` defaults to `_FORBIDDEN_KEYS` (`guid`/`obj_id`/`fqn`). A caller
    with a wider identity vocabulary to check for — this
    package's own `dataset_id`/`custom_file_guid` additions, documented
    identity-shaped keys the default set does not name — passes its own set rather
    than this module maintaining a second, wider copy of its own; the scan
    itself is shared either way, so the two vocabularies cannot drift apart
    the way two independently maintained scans could.

    `write_stash` is the single point every stashed payload passes through,
    so this is the one place the check needs to live for no caller — present
    or future — to bypass it by nesting identity content one level below a
    payload's own top-level keys instead of putting it there directly. A
    value copied wholesale from source data, rather than rebuilt field by
    field, is exactly how that happens in practice — the documented
    ThoughtSpot shape `geo_config.custom_file_guid` naming a custom map is
    one real example.
