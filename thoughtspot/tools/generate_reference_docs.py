"""Generate `docs/*.md` from the converter's own code.

This package's expression mapping, reverse inventory, datatype map and vendor
payload were originally hand-authored design documents. The code now
*implements* that mapping, which makes the code the single source of truth —
so this script reads it back out into Markdown, rather than a document being
maintained by hand a second time alongside it. `tests/test_reference_docs_current.py`
regenerates on every test run and compares the result against the committed
`docs/*.md` files byte-for-byte, so the two cannot silently drift apart.

**Not a runtime dependency.** This script is dev/tooling only: it is not
imported by anything under `src/`, it is not registered as a
`[project.scripts]` entry point, and it uses nothing beyond the Python
standard library plus this package's own modules — the package's only
*runtime* dependency stays PyYAML.

Usage::

    uv run --python 3.13 python tools/generate_reference_docs.py

Regenerates every file in `DOCS` under `docs/`. Run it, then `git diff` —
an empty diff means the docs were already current.
