# Apache Ossie ThoughtSpot Converter

Bidirectional, offline conversion between an [Apache Ossie](https://github.com/apache/ossie)
semantic model and ThoughtSpot TML. No ThoughtSpot connection required.

- **ThoughtSpot TML → Ossie** (`to-ossie`): reads a Model TML document plus the Table and
  SQL View documents it references, and emits one Ossie semantic model.
- **Ossie → ThoughtSpot TML** (`to-tml`): reads one Ossie semantic model and emits the
  corresponding set of TML documents.

A single Ossie semantic model corresponds to **1 + N TML documents**, not one file: one
`model:` document plus one `table:` or `sql_view:` document per dataset. The converter
reads and writes the set. File-to-file only — nothing here calls a ThoughtSpot API.

The `THOUGHTSPOT` dialect is registered upstream — apache/ossie#351 merged 2026-09-01.
Both conversion directions are implemented and tested: example-based unit tests, an
exact-document comparison against a shared TPC-DS fixture set (the same retail schema
every sibling converter round-trips), a round-trip suite asserting preservation and
translation separately, and a Hypothesis property-based suite over adversarial
identifiers.

## Installation

```bash
pip install apache-ossie-thoughtspot        # once published to PyPI
# or, from a checkout of this directory:
pip install -e .
```

The only runtime dependency is `PyYAML`. Python 3.10+.

## Usage

### Command line

```bash
ossie-thoughtspot to-ossie <tml-file>... -o <out.yaml>  [--issues <issues.json>] [--force]
ossie-thoughtspot to-tml   <ossie.yaml>  -o <out-dir>    [--issues <issues.json>] [--force]
```

`to-ossie` takes the Model TML document plus every Table/SQL View document it references
and writes one Ossie YAML file. `to-tml` takes one Ossie YAML document and writes the
corresponding TML document set — one file per document, tables before the model — into
an output directory it creates if needed.

`-o`/`--output` is required in both directions: `to-tml` writes a set of files that has
no single-file stdout representation, so unlike some sibling converters there is no
"default: stdout" fallback. Neither subcommand overwrites an existing output file unless
`--force` is given.

Every declared loss or degradation the conversion records is written as a JSON array of
issues — to `--issues` when given, to stderr otherwise — never mixed into the document
output. The process exits `1` when that issue log contains an ERROR-severity issue, `0`
otherwise: a conversion that only warned or informed about a declared loss is still a
successful conversion.

### Python API

```python
from ossie_thoughtspot import tml, tml_to_ossie, ossie_to_thoughtspot, _yaml

# ThoughtSpot TML -> Ossie
texts = [(path, open(path).read()) for path in ("model.model.tml", "orders.table.tml")]
result = tml_to_ossie.convert(tml.load_document_set(texts))
ossie_yaml = _yaml.dump(result.model)          # result.issues: IssueLog

# Ossie -> ThoughtSpot TML
ossie_document = _yaml.load(open("model.yaml").read())
result = ossie_to_thoughtspot.convert(ossie_document)
for filename, text in tml.dump_document_set(result.documents):
    ...                                          # result.issues: IssueLog
```

`result.issues` is an `IssueLog`: `has_errors()`, `count_by_severity()`, `as_dicts()`.
Every declared loss raises an issue here — see [Coverage matrix](#coverage-matrix) and
[Expression translation](#expression-translation-what-is-not-translated-and-why) below
for what gets declared and why.

## Mapping

| Ossie | ThoughtSpot TML | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| the semantic model (the document root) | one Model document + the Table/SQL View documents it references | One semantic model per document, its fields at the root beside `version`; a document still carrying the removed `semantic_model` wrapper is a hard failure naming it |
| `dataset` | `table:`/`sql_view:` document, surfaced via the Model's `model_tables[]` entry | One dataset per participating `model_tables[]` entry, not per physical table — a self-join or a table used twice gets two datasets sharing one `source` |
| `dataset.source` | `db`.`schema`.`db_table`, or `sql_query` for a SQL View | A dotted part is stashed individually (`source_parts`) when the joined form would be ambiguous |
| `dataset.fields` | Table `columns[]` (physical) or Model `formulas[]` + surfacing `columns[]` entry (computed) | A computed field is attributed to the one dataset every column reference in its expression resolves to; ambiguous or cross-dataset references raise an issue instead of guessing |
| `relationship` | `model_tables[].joins[]` (inline) or Table `joins_with[]` (referencing) | `from_columns`/`to_columns` are the join's equality pairs; a join with a non-equality residual (range/ASOF) narrows the same pairs, with the verbatim condition stashed — see [the payload section](#the-custom_extensionsthoughtspot-payload) below |
| `dataset.primary_key` / `unique_keys` | *(not native to TML)* | TML declares no keys; Ossie's are derived from to-one relationships targeting the dataset |
| `metric` | Model `formulas[]` + surfacing `columns[]` entry with `column_type: MEASURE` | Three TML shapes compose into one metric: a bare aggregate formula, a scalar formula plus the surfacing column's `aggregation`, or a physical column plus `aggregation` |
| `field`/`metric` `expression.dialects` | `formulas[].expr` or a physical `db_column_name` | See [Expression translation](#expression-translation-what-is-not-translated-and-why) |
| `custom_extensions[THOUGHTSPOT]` | TML fields with no Ossie equivalent | See [The `custom_extensions[THOUGHTSPOT]` payload](#the-custom_extensionsthoughtspot-payload) below |

## The `custom_extensions[THOUGHTSPOT]` payload

TML carries properties Ossie's core specification has no field for — a Connection name,
search-indexing settings, a display column's warehouse name when it differs from its
label, a join's exact type, and more. `TML → Ossie` stashes each one under a single
`custom_extensions` entry (`vendor_name: THOUGHTSPOT`) attached to the Ossie object it
came from; `Ossie → TML` reads the same entry back to reconstruct the original TML
property, so `TML → Ossie → TML` is lossless for everything TML itself can express.

```yaml
custom_extensions:
- vendor_name: THOUGHTSPOT
  data: '{"_v": 1, "connection_name": "My Snowflake", "tml_object": "table"}'
```

`data` is always a single JSON-encoded string (never a nested object — the core
specification requires this), carrying:

- `_v`, a shape version bumped only when the payload's *shape* changes, never for a
  value change — an unrecognised version is a hard failure rather than a silent
  misread of a shape this converter has never seen.
- Never a `guid`, `obj_id`, or `fqn` at any depth — object identity is instance-local
  and is refused outright rather than carried, at write time.
- Foreign-vendor `custom_extensions` entries on the same object pass through untouched
  in both directions.
- An object with nothing to stash gets no `custom_extensions[THOUGHTSPOT]` entry at
  all, so a converted document stays as small as its content requires.

`Ossie → TML` restores a stashed value only when it is still current: several keys
(a physical column's warehouse name, a relationship's verbatim join condition, a
dataset's TML object kind) are recorded alongside a witness copy of the live value they
were stashed next to, and the stash is used only when that witness still matches the
document's current value — an edit to the Ossie document since the stash was written
(retargeting a relationship, renaming a field) makes the stash stale for that key, and
the value is re-derived instead of silently reapplied to the wrong thing.

The full key vocabulary is documented in `src/ossie_thoughtspot/constants.py`, grouped
by which Ossie object each key's entry attaches to (model, dataset, relationship,
field/metric).

## Expression translation: what is not translated, and why

**A ThoughtSpot formula is captured verbatim under a `THOUGHTSPOT` dialect entry. A
portable `ANSI_SQL` sibling is added only when the whole expression is a single bare
column reference — the one shape where portability is certain. Every other shape — a
function call, an operator expression, a runtime parameter, a formula cross-reference —
is recorded THOUGHTSPOT-only, with an issue explaining why no portable sibling was
produced.** No SQL dialect is ever re-rendered into another dialect in this converter,
in either direction.

This is a deliberate design position, not an oversight, and it is worth stating plainly
rather than leaving it to be inferred from reading `tml_to_ossie.py`:

1. **The specification's own default is pass-through.** `core-spec/spec.md` defines
   `dialects[]` as a list of `{dialect, expression}` pairs precisely so a value a
   converter cannot translate can still travel, tagged with the dialect it is valid in.
   Emitting an untranslated ThoughtSpot expression under `THOUGHTSPOT` and stopping
   there is using the mechanism the specification provides for exactly this case, not
   working around a gap in it.
2. **No converter in this repository re-renders an expression from one SQL dialect into
   another.** Every sibling converter that meets a dialect it does not natively speak
   either passes the expression through under its own vendor dialect or falls back to
   `ANSI_SQL` when the source already provides one — none parses a foreign dialect's
   grammar and re-emits it in a different one. A hand-rolled reimplementation of that
   translation, done once per converter, is exactly the kind of duplicated, easy-to-get-
   subtly-wrong logic a shared SQL parser would exist to prevent — and no such shared
   parser exists in this project today. Building one is out of scope for a single
   converter to take on unilaterally.
3. **The reference converter (`converters/databricks`) tags its own vendor dialect and
   reads that first**, falling back to `ANSI_SQL` only when the source document already
   provides it — it does not translate a foreign dialect into its own either. This
   converter follows the same shape: prefer `THOUGHTSPOT`, add `ANSI_SQL` only when it
   can be produced with certainty, never invent a translation.

**What "certain" means in practice.** A bare column reference (`[TABLE::Column]`) is the
one shape this converter resolves without ambiguity: the reference names a physical or
computed field this document already knows how to place, so the `ANSI_SQL` sibling is
just that field's own dataset-qualified name — no expression semantics are being
translated at all, only a reference being resolved. Everything past that — even a
composition ThoughtSpot's own documentation says is exactly equivalent to a portable
form — is left THOUGHTSPOT-only. `src/ossie_thoughtspot/expressions/reverse.py` records,
for testing and future use, which of ThoughtSpot's native functions compose into a
portable Ossie expression and which do not (`ReverseDisposition`: compose fully,
compose partially, resolve only to a dialect entry, or have no Ossie form at all) — but
this inventory is not yet called from the shipped `TML → Ossie` conversion path itself.
The current release is more conservative than what that inventory shows is possible: it
never guesses, so it never translates something it has not resolved to a certainty.

**The complementary direction.** `Ossie → TML` faces the reverse problem: rendering an
Ossie specification construct as a ThoughtSpot formula. There, `expressions/catalog.py`
maps all 146 constructs the Ossie expression language defines to a ThoughtSpot rendering
— 108 with a native equivalent, 37 as a `sql_*_op` pass-through (opaque,
warehouse-dialect-specific SQL ThoughtSpot cannot introspect, logged at WARNING every
time), and 1 (`EXISTS_IN()`) with no representation ThoughtSpot has a slot for at all
(logged at ERROR, never silently dropped). This direction *can* translate constructs to
their ThoughtSpot equivalents because the Ossie expression language — unlike an
arbitrary ThoughtSpot formula — is the one grammar this converter fully parses; nothing
here reads or re-renders raw ThoughtSpot formula syntax, or any other vendor's SQL.

Read together with the [coverage matrix](#coverage-matrix) below, this is the
converter's whole answer to "what does not survive a round trip and why": expressions
pass through by declared design; every other construct's loss is declared per row.

## Coverage matrix

Every construct this converter does not carry, with its consequence. Each row raises a
structured `ConverterIssue` at conversion time — nothing is dropped silently.

| # | Construct | Limitation | Consequence |
|---|---|---|---|
| L1 | Object identity (`guid`, `obj_id`, `fqn`) | Not carried — instance-local by construction | A round-tripped document imports as a new object |
| L2 | Row-level security (`rls_rules`) | Not carried — rule expressions name instance-local groups. **ERROR severity**: a single issue is raised, its message naming every affected table | RLS is unrepresentable in Ossie core and is security-bearing; rules must be re-applied in the target for each table named in the error |
| L3 | Presentation artifacts (Answers, Liveboards, charts) | Out of scope — Ossie models semantics, not visualisations | No loss to the semantic model |
| L4 | Spotter coaching objects | Separate object types; `ai_context.examples` is not interchangeable | Coaching must be re-created in the target |
| L5 | Aggregate-model associations (`aggregated_models`) | Entries are GUIDs of other Models — instance-local | Query routing is silently disabled; the issue is the only signal |
| L6 | Worksheets, Views, Sets, Alerts, Model Aliases | Predecessors or layers, not models | Convert the Model the alias points at instead |

## Known limitations

Separate from the coverage matrix above — this covers identifier derivation
correctness, not TML constructs.

`identifiers.py`'s `normalise()` folds diacritics via Unicode NFKD decomposition before
lowercasing and substituting, so accented Latin normalises correctly: `"Café"` ->
`"cafe"`, `"Ürün"` -> `"urun"`, `"Zürich"` -> `"zurich"`. A character with **no ASCII
decomposition** (Cyrillic, CJK, and similarly non-Latin scripts) is still dropped, not
transliterated, and a name with no ASCII alphanumerics surviving still raises
`ValueError`. There is also an open question NFKD does not settle: some accented Latin
folds to a *conventional* ASCII expansion rather than the bare decomposed letter —
German `"Müller"` decomposes to `"Muller"` here, not the conventional `"Mueller"` — and
choosing between them is a product decision left to a later change.

## Rules

Earlier revisions of this converter's comments and docstrings cited short, letter-plus-
number rule identifiers drawn from an internal construct/expression mapping reference
that is not part of this repository and is not publicly readable — a citation of that
shape in the shipped source was therefore unresolvable from inside this repository
alone. That has been resolved: every such citation has been rewritten to state the
substance it stood for directly, in place, so nothing shipped here depends on material
outside this repository. `tests/test_shipped_references.py` enforces this going
forward — it fails the suite if a citation of that shape reappears in any shipped
file.

**Before declaring any expression untranslatable, consult the function mapping.** Many
window and LOD constructs have exact native equivalents; declaring one untranslatable
without checking is an error.

## Generated reference documentation

`docs/` holds four Markdown reference documents, generated from this converter's own
code rather than hand-authored — the code is the single source of truth for the
mapping each one describes, so a document maintained separately would only be able to
drift from it:

- [`docs/expression-mapping.md`](docs/expression-mapping.md) — every Ossie
  specification construct, its classification and its ThoughtSpot rendering, generated
  from `expressions/catalog.py`'s `CATALOG`.
- [`docs/reverse-inventory.md`](docs/reverse-inventory.md) — every ThoughtSpot-only
  function with no specification counterpart, and how it composes (or does not) back
  into a portable Ossie expression, generated from `expressions/reverse.py`'s `REVERSE`.
- [`docs/datatype-map.md`](docs/datatype-map.md) — the bidirectional datatype map and
  which types are declared lossy, generated from `datatypes.py`.
- [`docs/vendor-payload.md`](docs/vendor-payload.md) — every
  `custom_extensions[THOUGHTSPOT]` key, its scope and how it is treated on the return
  trip, generated from `constants.py`'s `STASH_KEY_CLASSIFICATION`.

`tools/generate_reference_docs.py` produces all four; it is dev/tooling only — not a
runtime dependency, not part of the wheel, not a `[project.scripts]` entry point.
Regenerate with:

```bash
uv run --python 3.13 python tools/generate_reference_docs.py
```

`tests/test_reference_docs_current.py` regenerates on every test run and compares the
result against the committed files byte-for-byte, so a `docs/*.md` file that has
drifted from the code it describes fails the suite rather than going unnoticed.

## Development

```bash
uv run --python 3.13 pytest tests/ -v
```

`uv run` syncs the `dev` dependency group (declared via PEP 735 `[dependency-groups]`,
not an extra — `pytest`, plus `jsonschema` and `hypothesis` for the schema-validation and
property-based suites) and runs the tests in one step — see
`.github/workflows/converter-thoughtspot-ci.yml` for the CI invocation this mirrors,
run across every Python version this package declares support for.

## Future effort

The Apache Ossie specification is still evolving. As it adds or changes fields, this
converter will be updated to track them — extending the mapping and coverage in both
directions to keep the conversion current and to support as much as the format allows
over time. `expressions/reverse.py`'s classified inventory of ThoughtSpot-only functions
is a candidate foundation for a future, more ambitious `TML → Ossie` composition
strategy, once that expansion is deliberately taken on rather than folded into this
release.
