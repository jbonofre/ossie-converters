# ThoughtSpot -> Ossie Reverse Inventory

ThoughtSpot's own native functions with no counterpart in the Ossie specification (`ThoughtSpot -> Ossie`, the reverse of the expression mapping above), and how each reaches — or does not reach — a portable Ossie expression. This inventory is not yet called from the shipped `TML -> Ossie` conversion path; see `converters/thoughtspot/README.md`'s "Expression translation" section for the converter's current, more conservative default.

## Reading the notation

| Notation | Means |
|---|---|
| `{0}`, `{1}`, `{2}` | A positional argument slot, filled left to right from the construct's own arguments. |

## Coverage

| Disposition | Count | Share | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| compose | 53 | 63% | A full, portable Ossie expression is produced. |
| partial | 8 | 10% | A real Ossie expression is produced, but it is provably incomplete. |
| dialect | 11 | 13% | Resolves to the Ossie `dialects[]` mechanism, not a portable expression. |
| stash | 12 | 14% | No Ossie expression exists at all; preserved verbatim for round-trip only. |
| **Total** | **84** | **100%** |  |

## Cross-cutting dispatch, not name-keyed

Two checks apply before an ordinary lookup by name into `REVERSE`, so they are not rows of the table below:

- **Fiscal-calendar argument.** Any call whose last argument is `'fiscal'`, `fiscal` stashes unconditionally, for any function name at all, before the name is looked up.
- **Hyperlink markup.** A `concat` call whose string arguments contain `{caption}` or `{/caption}` is redirected to the `concat (hyperlink markup)` row below; plain `concat` has a specification counterpart already covered by `CATALOG` and is not this module's concern.

## Every entry

| ThoughtSpot construct | Disposition | Composes to | Issue | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
