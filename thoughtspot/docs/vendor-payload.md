# The `custom_extensions[THOUGHTSPOT]` Payload

TML carries properties Ossie's core specification has no field for. `TML -> Ossie` stashes each one under a single `custom_extensions` entry attached to the Ossie object it came from; `Ossie -> TML` reads the same entry back. This page is generated from `constants.py`'s own key vocabulary and `STASH_KEY_CLASSIFICATION` — the table `test_stash_key_classification.py` enforces every key read on the `Ossie -> TML` direction must appear in.

## Envelope

Every `custom_extensions` entry this converter writes uses `vendor_name` `THOUGHTSPOT`. `data` is a single JSON-encoded string (never a nested object) whose own top-level `_v` field is the shape version (`1` today) — bumped only when the payload's shape changes, never for a value change; an unrecognised version is a hard failure rather than a silent misread.

## Payload keys

| Key | Scope | Classification | Treatment on the return trip |
|---|---|---|---|
| `tml_name` | Shared | shadows_derivable | Restored only if reconstructing it from the live document still agrees with the stashed value (self-verifying — no separate witness key); disagreement re-derives instead. |
| `column_aggregation_value` | Metric | information_only | Restored as-is whenever present: nothing on the Ossie side could have diverged from it. |
| `aggregation_explicit_none` | Metric | information_only | Restored as-is whenever present: nothing on the Ossie side could have diverged from it. |
| `tml_obj_id` | Model | information_only | Restored as-is whenever present: nothing on the Ossie side could have diverged from it. |
| `formula_id` | Field | information_only | Restored as-is whenever present: nothing on the Ossie side could have diverged from it. |
| `formula_name` | Field | information_only | Restored as-is whenever present: nothing on the Ossie side could have diverged from it. |
| `db_column_name` | Field | shadows_derivable | Restored only if its witness companion key still matches the live document's current value; a mismatch means the document changed since the stash was written, so the value is re-derived instead. |
| `data_type` | Field | shadows_derivable | Restored only if its witness companion key still matches the live document's current value; a mismatch means the document changed since the stash was written, so the value is re-derived instead. |
| `column_properties` | Field | information_only | Restored as-is whenever present: nothing on the Ossie side could have diverged from it. |
| `shape` | Metric | information_only | Restored as-is whenever present: nothing on the Ossie side could have diverged from it. |
| `tml_object` | Dataset | shadows_derivable | Restored only if its witness companion key still matches the live document's current value; a mismatch means the document changed since the stash was written, so the value is re-derived instead. |
| `source_parts` | Dataset | shadows_derivable | Restored only if reconstructing it from the live document still agrees with the stashed value (self-verifying — no separate witness key); disagreement re-derives instead. |
| `connection_name` | Dataset | information_only | Restored as-is whenever present: nothing on the Ossie side could have diverged from it. |
| `table_name` | Dataset | information_only | Restored as-is whenever present: nothing on the Ossie side could have diverged from it. |
| `alias` | Dataset | shadows_derivable | Restored only if reconstructing it from the live document still agrees with the stashed value (self-verifying — no separate witness key); disagreement re-derives instead. |
| `table_properties` | Dataset | information_only | Restored as-is whenever present: nothing on the Ossie side could have diverged from it. |
| `unsurfaced_columns` | Dataset | information_only | Restored as-is whenever present: nothing on the Ossie side could have diverged from it. Each list entry is additionally checked against live coverage before being restored: an entry now covered by a live field is dropped rather than duplicated. |
| `sql_output_columns` | Dataset | information_only | Restored as-is whenever present: nothing on the Ossie side could have diverged from it. |
| `on_expression` | Relationship | shadows_derivable | Restored only if its witness companion key still matches the live document's current value; a mismatch means the document changed since the stash was written, so the value is re-derived instead. |

| `cardinality` | Relationship | information_only | Restored as-is whenever present: nothing on the Ossie side could have diverged from it. |
| `endpoints_swapped` | Relationship | shadows_derivable | Restored only if its witness companion key still matches the live document's current value; a mismatch means the document changed since the stash was written, so the value is re-derived instead. |

## Witness companion keys

A `SHADOWS_DERIVABLE` key's stashed value is checked for currency before being restored; these are the witness copies that check does it against (see `stash.restore`).

| Witness key | Checks currency for |
|---|---|
| `tml_object_source_witness` | `tml_object` |
| `data_type_ossie_datatype_witness` | `data_type` |
| `db_column_name_display_name_witness` | `db_column_name` |
| `endpoints_swapped_witness` | `endpoints_swapped` |
| `on_expression_equality_witness` | `on_expression` |

## Nested keys under `source_parts`

| Sub-key | Full path |
|---|---|
| `db` | `source_parts.db` |
| `db_table` | `source_parts.db_table` |
| `schema` | `source_parts.schema` |

## `METRIC_STASH_SHAPE` value vocabulary

| Constant | Value |
|---|---|
| `METRIC_SHAPE_COLUMN_AGGREGATION` | `column_aggregation` |
| `METRIC_SHAPE_FORMULA` | `formula` |
| `METRIC_SHAPE_SCALAR_FORMULA_PLUS_AGGREGATION` | `scalar_formula_plus_aggregation` |

## Reclassified on a stash-only carrier

The same key name, reclassified when it is read off a stash-only carrier (an `unrepresentable_joins[]` or `unattributed_formulas[]` entry) that has no independent Relationship/Metric/Field object of its own to diverge from.

| Key | Classification (primary carrier) | Classification (stash-only carrier) |
|---|---|---|
| `on_expression` | shadows_derivable | information_only |
| `type` | information_only | information_only |
| `cardinality` | information_only | information_only |
| `column_properties` | information_only | information_only |
