"""The witness rule's enforcement point: every custom_extensions[THOUGHTSPOT] stash key
this converter reads on its Ossie -> TML direction has to declare, in
`constants.STASH_KEY_CLASSIFICATION`, whether it shadows a value this
converter could otherwise derive from the live Ossie document (and so needs
a witness and a currency check) or is information that exists nowhere else
(and so cannot go stale). Three keys were found reading the unsafe way
before this table existed — each found by generalising from the one before
it, never by a rule anyone consulted. This test is that rule, made
structural: a stash key read anywhere in ossie_to_thoughtspot.py that is
missing from the classification table fails here, so the question has to be
answered before the key is used, not left to memory.
