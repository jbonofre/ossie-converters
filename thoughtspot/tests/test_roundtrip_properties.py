"""Property-based round trip: `Ossie -> TML -> Ossie` over adversarial names.

test_roundtrip.py proves the round trip on documents this project's own
authors wrote -- fixtures and hand-built probes. Every one of those reflects
what its author thought to include, which is exactly the weakness a
generator can correct: it draws dataset and field display names from a pool
that *deliberately* includes the cases most likely to break identifier
handling -- YAML 1.1 boolean tokens (`on`, `off`, `yes`, `no`, `y`, `n`, and
every case variant), names that collide only after `identifiers.normalise`
folds them, non-ASCII names (both the kind NFKD decomposition folds to ASCII
and the kind it cannot), names containing `::`, leading/trailing whitespace,
punctuation-only text, very long text, and the empty string.

The property: the round trip is the identity on everything
`datatypes.declared_loss` calls lossless, and every difference beyond that
is covered by a reported issue. A silently dropped or silently mangled name
is a defect; the same name dropped *with* an issue naming it is a declared
loss, and the two are told apart here by checking the issue log, not by
trusting a document comparison alone.

Two real, previously uncaught crashes were found while writing this
suite -- both now fixed (see ossie_to_thoughtspot.py's `_physical_identity`/
`_field_physical_display_name` and tml_to_ossie.py's `convert`/
`_index_attribute_columns`) and both exercised directly by the properties
below, so a regression reopens loudly rather than silently. Every
*remaining* difference this suite predicts is computed by `_field_survives`
and `_expected_datatype` below, both built from the exact `identifiers`/
`datatypes` functions the converter itself calls -- an oracle, not a
hand-written parallel prediction that could quietly drift from what the
code actually does.

Each document also crosses the real YAML 1.2 codec (`tml.dump_document`/
`load_document` for the TML leg, `_yaml.dump`/`load` for the returned Ossie
document) rather than staying as Python objects the whole way through --
that text round trip is what actually exercises the boolean-token guard for
a name like "on" or "Off", not merely the pure conversion functions.
