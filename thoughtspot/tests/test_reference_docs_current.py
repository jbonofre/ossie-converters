"""Guard: the committed `docs/*.md` reference documents must equal what
`tools/generate_reference_docs.py` produces right now.

`docs/expression-mapping.md`, `docs/reverse-inventory.md`, `docs/datatype-map.md`
and `docs/vendor-payload.md` are generated, not hand-authored — the code
(`expressions/catalog.py`, `expressions/reverse.py`, `datatypes.py`,
`constants.py`) is the single source of truth for the mapping they describe.
Committing the generated output makes the reference readable on GitHub without
running anything; this test is what keeps a committed file from silently going
stale after the code it was generated from changes underneath it.

**Comparison is byte-exact (full string equality), deliberately.** A softer
comparison — ignoring whitespace, or checking only that each row's data is
*present* somewhere in the file — would tolerate the generator's own Markdown
formatting drifting out of sync with what is actually committed, which defeats
the point: the committed file must be reproducible from a single, deterministic
command, not merely "close enough". The generator has no non-deterministic
inputs (no timestamps, no unsorted set/dict iteration — every set-derived
listing in `tools/generate_reference_docs.py` is explicitly `sorted()`), so
byte-exact does not mean flaky. The trade-off this accepts: a purely cosmetic
change to the generator's Markdown layout (e.g. column order, a reworded
banner) requires regenerating and committing `docs/*.md` in the same change,
even though no *fact* in the tables moved — this is treated as a feature, not
a cost: it is the same discipline `test_shipped_references.py` already applies
to every other shipped file, and it is exactly what proves this test can fail
at all (see the module for how that was verified).
