"""Tests for the expression emitters.

Three emitter signatures, one per `Classification`:

    emit_direct(construct, args) -> str
    emit_passthrough(construct, args, log, *, object_ref, has_parameter=False) -> str
    emit_unmappable(construct, log, *, object_ref) -> None

`object_ref` is required on both issue-raising emitters: an issue names
the function, the object and the reason — an emitter that cannot name the object
structurally cannot satisfy it.
