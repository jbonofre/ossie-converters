"""The catalog must cover the specification's construct inventory, one to one.

This test reads the UPSTREAM core-spec/expression_language.md rather than any
document of our own. Oracling against our own mapping notes would only prove we
are self-consistent; reading the spec means a construct added upstream fails this
build instead of silently going unsupported.

spec_construct_names() and the mapping document's 146-row census count by
different units — one parseable table row/heading vs. one construct, which
also counts a handful of constructs the spec only describes in prose.
CONVENTION_DIVERGENCES (catalog.py) is the exact, reasoned list of the 9 where
that difference shows up; test_the_two_counts_reconcile pins the arithmetic so
the two counts cannot drift apart silently.
