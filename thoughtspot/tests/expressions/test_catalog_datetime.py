"""Catalog coverage: Date/time functions.

Source: the `Date/time functions` section of
docs/ossie/ts-ossie-function-mapping.md (thoughtspot-agent-skills repo, not
vendored here). 24 rows total — 17 direct / 7 passthrough / 0 unmappable.

Construct names are spelled exactly as `spec_construct_names()` extracts them
from the UPSTREAM core-spec/expression_language.md (see catalog.py's module
docstring, "Spelling" section) — several diverge from the mapping document's
own row header:

- The three "current" rows keep the spec's own joining word, "or": e.g.
  `"CURRENT_DATE or CURRENT_DATE()"`, not `CURRENT_DATE` / `CURRENT_DATE()`.
- `EXTRACT` and `DATE_PART` are bare tokens (from the "Alternative Extraction
  Syntax" code fence), not `EXTRACT(part FROM date_expr)` or
  `DATE_PART('part', date_expr)`.
- The typed-literal and EXPERIMENTAL rows match only the backticked portion of
  the mapping document's row header — the trailing `(typed literal)` /
  `(EXPERIMENTAL)` annotation sits outside the backtick span and is not part
  of the key: `"DATE '2024-01-15'"`, `"TIMESTAMP_NTZ '2024-01-15 10:30:00'"`,
  `"TIME '10:30:00'"`, `"TO_DATE(string, format)"`,
  `"TO_TIMESTAMP(string, format)"`, `"TO_CHAR(date_expr, format)"`.
