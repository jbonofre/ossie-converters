"""Catalog coverage: Mathematical and Conditional functions.

Source: the `Mathematical functions` and `Conditional functions` sections of
docs/ossie/ts-ossie-function-mapping.md (thoughtspot-agent-skills repo, not
vendored here). 34 rows total — 32 direct / 2 passthrough / 0 unmappable.

Nearly everything here is direct, several by composition: SIGN is an
`if` chain with a mandatory `else 0` (ThoughtSpot rejects an `if` with no
`else`); RADIANS/DEGREES are bare arithmetic (no native function); PI is a
literal at the precision ThoughtSpot's own documented composites use.
ThoughtSpot trigonometry is in degrees while the specification is in radians,
so every forward trig function multiplies by 180/pi and every inverse trig
function divides by it — the opposite conversion, easy to get backwards.
GREATEST/LEAST are deliberately not MAX/MIN: ThoughtSpot's max/min are
aggregate-only, so mapping the row-wise N-ary forms onto them would both
collapse the column to one value and flip it from attribute to measure.

Only two rows are passthrough: TRUNC/TRUNCATE (no native truncation, and
neither floor nor round is a safe substitute) and ATAN2 (quadrant-aware and
defined where x = 0, so it is not a two-argument ATAN composition).

Construct names in this family are spelled identically to the mapping
document's own row headers, with the same alias-merge convention as CEIL/
CEILING and TRUNC/TRUNCATE (see catalog.py's module docstring, "Spelling"
section) — the merged spelling (`CEIL(x)`, `TRUNC(x, d)`) is what
`spec_construct_names()` actually extracts, confirmed live before writing
this file.
