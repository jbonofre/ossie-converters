"""Catalog coverage: Window functions - the last family, completing the catalog.

Source: the `Window functions` section of docs/ossie/ts-ossie-function-mapping.md
(thoughtspot-agent-skills repo, not vendored here), plus the "Window rows
live-confirmed - 2026-07-30" section that records the 52-probe evidence behind the
classifications. 14 rows total - 5 direct / 9 passthrough / 0 unmappable.

This is the hardest family. Three constraints govern it:

- A raw aggregate cannot be nested inside a ThoughtSpot window function.
- The ORDER BY column must be a physical column reference, not a formula.
- A ThoughtSpot window formula cannot declare its own PARTITION BY; the
  partition is always completed from the query's own dimensions. This is why nine
  of fourteen rows are passthrough, and why LAG, LEAD, the OVER clause and window
  aggregation moved direct -> passthrough after 52 live probes on 2026-07-30.
  `rank` / `rank_percentile` have arity fixed at exactly two, proven by rejection
  on a live instance (`Function rank expects only 2 arguments`).

`FIRST_VALUE` / `LAST_VALUE` are the section's one exception: they take a genuine
explicit partition argument and a genuine explicit order axis, so the formula does
define its own window, and they stay direct along with `RANK`, `PERCENT_RANK` and
the frame-clause boundaries (whose native reach is now proven by rejection rather
than asserted).

`PERCENT_RANK` is direct via `rank_percentile`, but `CUME_DIST` is deliberately
NOT: `PERCENT_RANK` divides by n-1 and starts at 0; `CUME_DIST` divides by n and
ends at 1. They agree on no row of a tie-free window except the last, so
`rank_percentile` is not a substitute and `CUME_DIST` stays passthrough with no
native fallback at all.

Three of the family's 14 rows have no discrete row of their own in the upstream
core-spec/expression_language.md - the generic `OVER (...)` syntax template and its
frame-clause bullet list are a fenced code block, and window aggregation is prose -
so they are keyed via `CONVENTION_DIVERGENCES` rather than `spec_construct_names()`:
the `OVER` clause, the frame clause, and window aggregation. The other 11 rows key
on `spec_construct_names()`'s own extraction from the "Ranking Functions" and
"Offset Functions" tables' `Syntax` column - confirmed live before writing this
file.
