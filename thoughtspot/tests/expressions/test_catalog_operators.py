"""Catalog coverage: Operators and constructs.

Source: the `Operators and constructs` section of
docs/ossie/ts-ossie-function-mapping.md (thoughtspot-agent-skills repo, not
vendored here). 33 rows total - 30 direct / 2 passthrough / 1 unmappable.

This is the only family with an `unmappable` row in the whole 146-row catalog:
`EXISTS_IN()` is named at :131 as the sanctioned way to filter on a subquery,
but the specification never defines it anywhere - no signature, no argument
order, no semantics. `str ILIKE pattern` is passthrough because
case-insensitive matching has no native form (and the usual `lower`
workaround is itself a passthrough); `DISTINCT` as an aggregate modifier is
passthrough because ThoughtSpot has exactly one distinct-aware aggregate
(`unique count`, i.e. `COUNT(DISTINCT)`, already its own row) and nothing
else. `str LIKE pattern` stays direct despite ThoughtSpot having no native
`starts_with`/`ends_with`: the prefix/suffix/contains compositions use only
native functions.

Six of the family's 33 rows have no discrete row of their own in the upstream
core-spec/expression_language.md - they are named only in prose, a bullet
list, or an "Operator Precedence"/"Not Supported" table with no backtick
marker - so they are keyed via `CONVENTION_DIVERGENCES` rather than
`spec_construct_names()`: unary `-x`/`+x`, the simple `CASE` form,
`Parentheses`, the `DISTINCT` modifier, the column/metric reference, and
`EXISTS_IN()` itself. The other 27 rows key on `spec_construct_names()`'s own
extraction - confirmed live before writing this file - which for this family
means the BARE operator/keyword token, not the mapping document's `a op b`
worked-example header: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`, `=`, `<>`, `!=`, `<`, `>`,
`<=`, `>=`, `BETWEEN`, `IN`, `NOT IN`, `NOT expr`, `IS NULL`, `IS NOT NULL`,
`IS DISTINCT FROM`, `IS NOT DISTINCT FROM`, `CASE WHEN`, `TRUE, FALSE`,
`expr1 AND expr2`, `expr1 OR expr2`, `str LIKE pattern`, `str ILIKE pattern`,
`str1 || str2`.
