"""The reverse-direction inventory (ThoughtSpot -> Ossie).

Source: the "Reverse direction (ThoughtSpot -> Ossie)" section of
docs/ossie/ts-ossie-function-mapping.md (thoughtspot-agent-skills repo, not
vendored here), all three sub-sections: conditional aggregates and arithmetic
helpers; window, LOD and semi-additive functions; runtime, display and
calendar concepts.

One assertion group per ThoughtSpot function: does it compose, or
does it stash (custom_extensions + issue)? Composers assert the
exact emitted Ossie expression. Stash/partial entries assert the issue's
code, severity and object_ref, since every stash issue names the function,
the object and the reason.
