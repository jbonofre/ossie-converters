"""Catalog coverage: String functions.

Source: the `String functions` section of docs/ossie/ts-ossie-function-mapping.md
(thoughtspot-agent-skills repo, not vendored here). 21 rows total — 10 direct /
11 passthrough / 0 unmappable.

This family is over half passthrough, and the reasons are counter-intuitive:
TRIM/LTRIM/RTRIM/REPLACE/LOWER/UPPER are passthrough because ThoughtSpot has no
native trim/replace/lower/upper function at all — not because they behave
differently. STARTSWITH/ENDSWITH are the opposite surprise: direct despite
having no native function, because the composition out of strpos/substr/strlen
is exact and uses only native functions.

Construct names in this family are spelled identically to the mapping
document's own row headers — none of this family's keys diverge the way CAST/
TRY_CAST or the Date/time typed literals did (see catalog.py's module
docstring, "Spelling" section, and `spec_construct_names()` itself).
