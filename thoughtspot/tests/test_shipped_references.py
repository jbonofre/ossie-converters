"""Guard: nothing shipped may cite a document a repository-only reader cannot see.

This package was developed against internal design material that is not part of
this repository and will not be. Two shapes of unresolvable reference leak in as a
result, and this module checks for both every time the suite runs, so a new one
introduced by future work is caught immediately rather than found by the next
person who happens to grep for it by hand.

**Identifier-shaped citations** — a short run of uppercase letters immediately
followed by digits, with an optional hyphen between the two, the shape a rule id
or a backlog-style item number is written in — are handled fail-closed: every
token of that shape actually present in a shipped file is collected, a curated
ALLOWED_TOKENS set of genuinely unrelated technical tokens (data types, encodings,
lint codes, ...) is subtracted, and a second set — MAPPING_DOC_RULE_IDS, held
permanently empty now that every mapping-document rule-id family it once
allowed has had its citation rewritten in place — is subtracted too, and
*anything left over fails the suite*. A blocklist can only catch an id someone
already thought to list; this can't be evaded that way, because the burden is
on a new token to justify itself, not on this file to have predicted it.

**Ordinary-English process language** — internal task-tracking, multi-option
planning, and change-review vocabulary that reads as a normal sentence and so
has no identifier shape a scanner can key off — stays a hand-curated,
case-insensitive phrase blocklist for that reason. It trades recall for
precision in the other direction: it can miss a new phrasing, but it will not
fail to explain a hit.

Both halves run over the *actual shipped surface* — every ``.py`` file under
``src/`` and ``tests/`` (this file included — a guard that exempts itself is not
a guard), ``README.md``, ``pyproject.toml``, and this package's own CI workflow
file if one is ever added directly under the package directory.

# package (A/E/G/ID/KD/NM/R/X, and finally I) has now been made the same way:
# the internal mapping/invariant reference each one cited is not shipping, so
# every citation has been rewritten in place to state its substance directly
# (see README.md's "Rules" section for the full account). None remain
# allowed, so this set is empty — a citation of this shape now fails the
# suite like any other unresolvable reference.
#
# This name stays defined, rather than being deleted along with the families
# it used to hold, only because test_allowed_token_sets_do_not_overlap and
# the union in test_no_unresolvable_identifier_shaped_tokens still refer to
# it by name; removing it would mean rewriting those tests' structure, not
# just their comments. It is not a container to drop a new id into: a future
# citation of this shape gets the same treatment every prior one did (state
# the substance in place), and only a fresh, reasoned decision — recorded
# here the way this comment records the last one — may repopulate it.

# original instructions document, a named human role in that process and the
# cycle of revising drafts against its feedback, and the internal agent-skill
# framework with its planning/tracking directories.
#
# Every pattern below leads with `\b` (a word-boundary assertion). That choice
# is deliberate, not incidental: it is also what keeps this module passing its
# own check below. In this file's own source text, each pattern's *raw
# characters* read literally as backslash-b-then-the-phrase (e.g. the actual
# bytes of the fourth pattern are `\btranscribed\b`), so the phrase is always
# immediately preceded by the letter "b" from that escape — a word character
# butted against another word character, which is never a word boundary. A
# pattern can therefore never match its own definition here. This was verified
# by running this suite against this file, not just reasoned about.
