"""Round-trip tests, in both directions, over both fixture sets.

A round trip that only compares documents is a weaker test than it looks. The
return leg of `TML -> Ossie -> TML` reads the expression back out of the
THOUGHTSPOT dialect entry, which `tml_to_ossie.py` always writes verbatim --
so the original formula text comes back byte for byte whether or not the
*portable* ANSI_SQL sibling next to it was ever built correctly. A round trip
that only asserts the documents match can pass while translation is entirely
broken, because preservation and translation are proved by two different
code paths that happen to feed the same comparison. So this module asserts
them separately: `TestTmlRoundTripReproduces*` proves preservation (the
document set comes back, expressions held to exact string equality);
`TestTmlRoundTripTranslat*` proves translation, directly on the ANSI_SQL
siblings the intermediate Ossie document carries -- these fail on a
translation regression even when every preservation assertion still passes.

A round trip that only compares documents is also blind to the issue log,
and the issue log is this converter's whole contract with whoever reads it:
a conversion that silently drops something and one that reports the same
drop correctly produce identical documents. Every assertion below that
checks a real difference also checks that the issue log named it -- object
and all -- rather than trusting a bare count.

Not every difference this module finds is a defect. `test_minimal_model_
reproduces_every_column_and_formula_except_the_aggregation_convention` and
its tpcds counterpart document a difference the converter's own code
already explains and justifies -- collapsing three ThoughtSpot Model
TML metric shapes into one on the way out. That is asserted as the
current, intentional behaviour.

Two further differences this module found while it was first written had
no such justification anywhere in the source, and were deliberately NOT
asserted as correct -- baking in a value nobody has justified is exactly
how a real regression gets permanently disguised as a passing test. Both
have since been fixed in `ossie_to_thoughtspot.py`, and this module now
asserts the fix directly instead of excluding the field it touches: a
physical Table column no longer gains a `description` its own document
never had (see `_columns_by_name` and the dedicated description test), and
a relationship whose join was Table-referenced keeps its own `name` and
its Table `joins_with[]` entry across the round trip, restored from the
stash rather than resynthesized -- with a currency check, so a relationship
renamed after the stash was written falls back to the old, safe behaviour
instead of restoring a stale reference under the wrong name (see
`TestReferencingJoinRestoration`).
