"""One Apache Ossie semantic model to a set of AML source files.

`convert` returns `(relative path, text)` pairs rather than writing them, so the
CLI owns every filesystem decision and a test can read the output without a
temporary directory.

The layout is one dataset file plus one model file per Ossie dataset:

    <dataset>.dataset.aml
    orders.model.aml                      an Ossie dataset named orders
    modules/reporting/calendar.model.aml  an Ossie dataset named reporting__calendar

The input file layout is lost on the way in. The compiled JSON the forward path
reads records which models a dataset holds and not which file each came from, so
the layout is already gone by the time a document reaches Ossie. AML accepts any
arrangement, so the generator picks the one above.

Four AML properties are required and have no Ossie field: `label` and `type` on
every dimension and measure, and `data_source_name` and `relationships` on the
dataset. A stashed value wins. Otherwise `label` is derived from the name the
way AML itself derives it, `type` from `datatype`, and `data_source_name` from
the `--data-source-name` argument.
