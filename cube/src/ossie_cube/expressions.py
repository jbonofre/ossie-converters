"""Reading the structure of an Ossie metric expression.

Cube expects a measure to *be* an aggregation -- `type: sum` over a column -- and
falls back to a calculated `type: number` measure whose sql carries the whole
aggregate. A composite Ossie metric such as

    SUM(store_sales.amount) / COUNT(DISTINCT customer.id)

can be emitted either way, and the difference matters: as one calculated measure
Cube sees a single opaque expression, whereas as two `public: false` measures on
their own cubes plus a ratio referencing them, **Cube applies its row-multiplication
correction to each aggregate independently**. So decomposition is a correctness
improvement for cross-dataset metrics, not a formatting choice.

Locating the aggregate calls is done with sqlglot rather than a regex, since an
expression can nest them (`SUM(x) / NULLIF(SUM(y), 0)`) and string matching cannot
tell a top-level call from one inside another argument. sqlglot is already a runtime
dependency of the dbt and NVIDIA Auto Ontology converters for the same purpose.

    which dataset every column belongs to, and a path in a cube's own SQL is that
    cube's: `payload.amount` is a struct field of the cube's table, so the whole path is
    qualified. A path rooted at a `{...}` reference is left alone. Cube aliases each
    cube's table by the cube's name, so a path starting with `own_cube` reads the own
    table (`orders.amount` becomes `{CUBE}.amount`), and one starting with another of
    `cube_names` could be that cube's table or a struct field, and is refused.

    One aggregate call spanning the whole text is a single term by definition, which
    the character scan cannot see for an ordered-set aggregate: the space in
    `PERCENTILE_CONT(0.5) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY users.ltv)` sits at depth 0 and reads
    as structure. Parenthesizing it was not merely untidy -- inlining happens once per
    round trip, so each cycle added another pair and the expression grew without
    bound, which is an idempotence break. Asking the scanner keeps the two readings of
    "one aggregate call" from drifting apart.

    Only *whitespace* at depth 0 is ambiguous that way. An operator there cannot occur
    inside a single call -- everything after the name is parenthesized, and an
    ordered-set aggregate puts only `WITHIN GROUP` between its two groups -- so it
    settles the question outright. That ordering is what keeps the scanner off the hot
