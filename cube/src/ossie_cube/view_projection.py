"""Project one Cube view's public surface onto an Apache Ossie semantic model.

`convert_cube_to_ossie` is a lossless round-trip import: every cube member becomes an
Ossie field or metric, and the view's curation rides in `custom_extensions`. Publishing
a view to another tool needs the opposite boundary -- exactly the members the view
exposes, under the names it exposes them by, and nothing the view keeps private.

The projection resolves the view (its members, join tree and hidden dependencies),
builds a reduced cube set holding only those, runs the ordinary import over it, and
trims the result to the published surface. Dimension references are inlined while the
set is built, in Cube space, so the import's own join decomposition and fan-out analysis
read the columns a member really uses; measure references are inlined afterwards by the
import's `_MeasureResolver`. Anything the published model could not say faithfully is
refused with a `ConversionError`, never dropped. See README "View projection".

Usage (CLI):
    ossie-cube import -i model/ --view sales --project [--source orders]
