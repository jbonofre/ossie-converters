# Ossie ↔ Hex converter

Bidirectional, offline conversion between
[Apache Ossie][apache-ossie] and [Hex][hex-semantic-spec].

- **Export** (`ossie-hex export`): Ossie → Hex

## Installation

This converter is distributed as a Python package. Install it with `uv` or
`pip`:

```bash
uv tool install ossie-hex

# Alternatively
pip install ossie-hex
```

Requires Python 3.11 or newer.

## Usage

### Command line

#### `export`

Convert one Ossie semantic model document into one Hex semantic project.

```bash
ossie-hex export -i <file> -o <directory> \
  [--dialect <dialect>] [-v]
```

Options:

- `-i, --input <file>` — Required. Ossie YAML file to export.
- `-o, --output <directory>` — Optional. Directory where Hex YAML files are
  written. If omitted, the current working directory is used.
- `-d, --dialect <dialect>` — Optional. Ossie dialect to pick from Ossie
  expressions. If omitted, `ANSI_SQL` is used.
- `-v, --verbose` — Optional. Show a grouped problem summary. Repeat the flag
  (`-vv`) to show every occurrence with its conversion phase and cause path.

Example:

```bash
ossie-hex export -i ossie.yaml -o hex/ --dialect snowflake
```

### Python API

#### `convert_ossie_to_hex`

Convert one Ossie semantic model document into one Hex semantic project.

```python
from ossie_hex import convert_ossie_to_hex

hex_project, problems = convert_ossie_to_hex(
    input="ossie.yaml",
    output="hex/",
    dialect="snowflake",
)
```

Options:

- `input` — Required. Ossie YAML file to export.
- `output` — Optional. Directory where Hex YAML files are written. If omitted,
  no files are written.
- `dialect` — Optional. Ossie dialect to pick from Ossie expressions. If
  omitted, `ANSI_SQL` is preferred, falling back to the first available variant.

Returns: a tuple of

- `hex_project`: A Hex semantic project, or `None` if conversion could not
  produce a project.
- `problems`: A list of problems encountered.

## Conversion

The conversion between Ossie and Hex is a multi-step process that is not
one-to-one. It is designed such that the maximal set of information is
returned to the caller. Problems are returned in such a way that
the source can be identified and problem understood from the message alone.

### Phases

Conversion proceeds in three distinct phases, sometimes with sub-phases.

- `load`: Read file(s) from disk. Deserialize and parse file contents. Validate
  and construct in-memory representation(s).
- `convert`: Transform syntax. Validate and construct target domain
  model(s).
  - `analyze`: Parse expressions and validate semantic references.
  - `assign`: Decide where incongruities between source and target data should
    be resolved.
- `dump`: Serialize and encode in-memory representation(s) into the target
  format. Write file(s) to disk.

### Problems

Conversion reports problems encountered. The severity of a problem is one of:

- `fatal`: The problem causes invalidation that cannot be recovered from, or
  an unexpected internal error.
- `error`: The problem makes a definition invalid or ambiguous. The definition
  may be omitted and affect later conversions.
- `warning`: The problem is a potential issue that probably should be addressed,
  but is not critical. The associated definitions may behave unexpectedly,
  but are included in the result.
- `info`: The problem is a general informational message that is not an issue.

Each problem contains a `cause_path` which identifies the key of the source
data where the problem occurred. The conversion `phase` in which the problem
occurred is also reported.

### Concepts

The table below shows how Ossie and Hex concepts correspond, and where a concept
in one format has no direct equivalent in the other. Backticks identify literal
fields in each format. Where a concept exists in Hex but is not supported in
Ossie, then data is preserved in the `HEX` custom extension on import. Where a
concept exists in Ossie but is not supported in Hex, then data is omitted on
export.

conversion is not one-to-one.
