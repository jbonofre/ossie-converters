# apache-ossie-orionbelt

Bidirectional converter between **OBML** (OrionBelt Markup Language) semantic
models and **Ossie** ([Apache Ossie](https://ossie.apache.org/)),
the open standard for portable semantic models (metrics, dimensions,
relationships).

This package is licensed under **Apache-2.0** and may be used freely. It is the
OrionBelt converter in the Ossie converter ecosystem. The canonical source is
developed in the
[orionbelt-semantic-layer](https://github.com/ralfbecher/orionbelt-semantic-layer)
repository (under `packages/ossie-orionbelt`) and published to PyPI from there;
file issues and contributions upstream.

Ossie documents contain one model directly at the root, with `version`, `name`,
`datasets`, and optional model properties. Legacy `semantic_model` wrappers
(arrays or objects) are rejected.

## Requirements

- Python 3.12+
- [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) (recommended) or pip

## Install

```bash
pip install apache-ossie-orionbelt
```

Optional deep OBML semantic validation (cycles, duplicate names, invalid refs)
via the full OrionBelt engine:

```bash
pip install "apache-ossie-orionbelt[obml-validation]"
```

Without that extra, OBML validation runs JSON-schema checks only and emits a
warning for the deeper semantic pass.

## CLI

A single `ossie-orionbelt` command with two subcommands (mirroring `ossie-dbt`):

| Subcommand | Direction | In | Out |
|---------|-----------|----|----|
| `obml-to-ossie` | OBML -> Ossie core-spec | OBML YAML | Ossie YAML |
| `obml-to-ossie --ontology` | OBML -> Ossie ontology | OBML YAML | Ossie ontology YAML |
| `ossie-to-obml` | Ossie core-spec -> OBML | Ossie YAML | OBML YAML |

```bash
ossie-orionbelt obml-to-ossie -i model.obml.yaml -o model.ossie.yaml
ossie-orionbelt obml-to-ossie --ontology -i model.obml.yaml -o model.ontology.yaml
ossie-orionbelt ossie-to-obml -i model.ossie.yaml -o model.obml.yaml
```

`-i/--input` and `-o/--output` are required. Each subcommand prints conversion
warnings and a validation summary to stderr, and exits non-zero when the
produced document fails schema validation (unless `--no-validate`). Run
`ossie-orionbelt --help` or `ossie-orionbelt obml-to-ossie --help` for the full
option list.

## Python API

```python
import yaml
from ossie_orionbelt import OBMLtoOssie, OssietoOBML, validate_ossie

obml = yaml.safe_load(open("model.obml.yaml"))
ossie = OBMLtoOssie(obml, "sales", "Sales model").convert()
result = validate_ossie(ossie)
assert result.schema_validation_performed and result.valid

obml_again = OssietoOBML(ossie).convert()
```

## Metric expressions

Other Ossie consumers read a metric's SQL, not the `ORIONBELT` extension, so the
OBML to Ossie export writes SQL that computes what OrionBelt computes:

- columns are referenced as `"<dataset>"."<field>"`, always double-quoted;
- measure filters become `AGG(CASE WHEN <condition> THEN <arg> END)`, totals the
  grand-total window `SUM(SUM(x)) OVER ()`, and `defaultValue` a `COALESCE`;
- synthesized counts and metric-on-metric `{[Name]}` references are inlined;
- cumulative and window metrics order and partition by each dimension at its
  `timeGrain`, as the query groups it.

A measure or metric with no faithful single expression (period-over-period,
`grain`, `filterContext`, `anchor`, nested windows, reference cycles) is left out
of the Ossie metrics with a warning and kept whole in the model-level extension
(`obml_unexported`). Every exported measure and metric also carries its OBML
definition, and every field its OBML column name, so Ossie to OBML restores the
original model instead of re-parsing the SQL.

`validate_ossie` checks JSON Schema conformance, unique names, and relationship
references. If the schema file or `jsonschema` package is unavailable, it emits
a warning and reports `JSON Schema: skipped`. The result's
`schema_validation_performed` flag is `False` in that case.

This fallback provides partial validation: it rejects non-object roots and
legacy `semantic_model` wrappers, and checks unique names and references in
entries it can traverse. Required fields and field types are not checked, so
documents missing `name` or `datasets`, with malformed `datasets`, or with a
dataset missing `source` can still return `valid=True`. That value means only
that the checks performed found no errors. Require both
`schema_validation_performed` and `valid`, as above, when structural validity
is required.

## Vendor extensions

Ossie `custom_extensions` carry vendor-tagged payloads. This converter:

- emits OrionBelt/OBML-proprietary data under the **`ORIONBELT`** vendor on OBML
  to Ossie (OBML-only filters, settings, owner, refresh, type info, etc.);
- stashes Ossie-native fields that OBML can't represent (unique keys, field
  labels, leftover `ai_context`) under the **`Ossie`** vendor when going Ossie to
  OBML, restoring them to first-class Ossie fields on the way back;
- **preserves third-party vendor extensions verbatim** (e.g. `SNOWFLAKE`,
  `DBT`, `SALESFORCE`, `GOODDATA`) at the model, dataset, field, and
  measure/metric levels, so a full Ossie to OBML to Ossie roundtrip keeps the
  original vendor and data. Ossie has no separate dimension entity, so an OBML
  dimension's foreign extensions surface on its Ossie field.

Legacy `COMMON` / `OBSL` tags from earlier converter versions are still accepted
on read.

## Limitations / unsupported constructs

Some OBML constructs have no native Ossie equivalent and are carried in vendor
`custom_extensions` (`obml_*` payloads) so they round-trip without loss back to
OBML, but are not interpreted by other Ossie consumers:

- **Many-to-many joins** - represented in OBML join cardinality; flagged on
  export.
- **Named secondary join paths** - OBML's multiple join paths between the same
  pair of objects are an OBML-specific topology feature.
- **Measures / metrics and column-level value concepts in the ontology layer** -
  not represented in the Ossie ontology export.
- **Ossie metrics with no OBML representation** - a metric whose only expression is
  in a non-SQL dialect (`MDX`, `TABLEAU`, `MAQL`), or whose SQL expression cannot
  be decomposed into OBML measures/metrics, is **not** dropped: the original Ossie
  metric is preserved verbatim in a model-level `Ossie`-vendor `custom_extension`
  (`obml_unconverted_metrics`) and re-emitted on OBML to Ossie, so the Ossie to OBML
  to Ossie roundtrip stays lossless. A `LOSSY:` warning is raised for each such
  metric because it is **not queryable through OBML**. SQL expressions in the
  `ANSI_SQL`, `OSSIE_SQL_2026`, `SNOWFLAKE`, and `DATABRICKS` dialects are all read on import.

Ossie v0.1.x inputs are accepted on read via a legacy normalization shim; output
targets Ossie **v0.2.0.dev0**.
